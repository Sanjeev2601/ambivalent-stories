Content: I honestly have no idea, whether or not it counts as sexual assault, but I do know, i wouldn't touch anyone in that manner, unless I was already intimate with them, and it is something we normally do. As to me it seems too intimate to do.

With that said, I also wake up my kids that way sometimes. With the duvet/blanket between my hand and their body, so I place my hand on the lower back of their back if they lay on their stomach, or their hip, if they are laying sideways, and then I sort of bounce them like a basketball in their beds. 

For friends I'd at most nudge their shoulders, or poke their backs, again with the duvet/blanket between us.

I went on a tinder date to meet up with a guy who was both cute and friend of my coworker's. I have gone on plenty of Tinder dates before, but I felt like this one had a better chance of being good because of the mutual connection. I ended up having to work late, so I didn't meet up with him till late, but the vibe was calm and casual, not booty-call-esque. We had a drink and chatted about work and normal first date BS. Then we went to a jazz club and were really having a lot of fun. He was nice, funny, and I was having a great time. Being at a jazz club, we started chatting about our music tastes and agreed to go to his apartment nearby so we could share some favorites. 

At this point, I had no creepy vibe or uncomfortable feelings. I hadn't made any moves and neither had he in terms of sexual flirty stuff. So we got to his place and we started playing songs for each other and chatting some more. At some point, he pulled me closer to him and kissed me, which was an entirely welcome advance. So, we kissed for awhile and he gave me a back rub. It was late, probably about 2am, and he asked me to stay over. I hesitated, because I knew I didn't want to have sex, but decided to anyway for the draw of cuddling and making out. I told him then that I wasn't interested in having sex, which he was fine with. So, we climbed into bed and continued making out again. He started to make some moves and I stopped him and reminded him that I wasn't interested in having sex. He said okay and backed off again. So we keep making out and are getting pretty into it when suddenly I realize he's pulled his dick out. I was startled but didn't say anything. I didn't really know what to say. I wanted to leave at that point, but I just didn't know how to say ""Nope, I'm out."" So he tries to get me to jerk him off and I stop and say that I don't want to, which he sorta laughs and fakes being bummed about, then backs off again for a bit before doing it again. This continued, each time me stopping him when he started asking me to participate. At this point, I felt really uncomfortable and started to think that he was going to completely blow past me and just have sex with me. So, finally, he had his dick out again and was starting to try to pull my underwear off when I stopped him again and told him he really needed to stop that. So, he stopped and we ended up falling asleep. In the morning, there was some more of that before we finally got up and we got some coffee before parting. 

I'm torn. On one hand, he definitely ignored the vast majority of my pleas to stop. On the other hand, I didn't really forcefully stop him. I was more or less an active participant, at one point letting him put his penis between my thighs while he basically dry humped me. Some of it physically felt sorta good, despite the fact that I really didn't want to do anything sexual with that guy in that moment. 

I don't know how I feel about it. A little confused. Disappointed in myself for not jumping up and walking out the moment I felt uncomfortable. I don't feel particularly freaked out at all. I feel weirdly different, weirdly unsettled, but not scared or hurt or upset. If anything, I'm just upset that someone would so blatantly ignore what I had to say, especially since he had seemed so nice and normal all night before that. 

Any thoughts or bits of advice or pretty much anything would be helpful.

Content: No, it's a dating app. You can use it for hook ups, if that's your thing, but it is not exclusively for that purpose.

Comment (depth 2):
Author: tezzmosis
Content: Is it really? Only ever heard of it being a hook up app. I dated before Tindr, and even now if I had to date I can't see myself using it to find a serious date. Something a bit sleazy about being able to order a woman the same way you'd order a pizza. 

Don't meet up and take someone to bed if you don't want to sleep with them? I mean if you're already ordering a date like a hot pizza pie, shouldn't you have your intentions sorted out ahead of time? If you're making out and start taking clothes off, its sort of a mixed signal when you suddenly say stop. I've never had a girl say stop though, so maybe I'm biased.

That's not how the app works. It puts you in contact with people in your locality who find you mutually attractive based on their photos and profile. You can then exchange messages and if you like each other, agree to go on a date at a time convenient for you both. You can't just ""order a woman"".

I couldn’t go on the trip since i had work, so i was staying home to house sit and feed our animals. My stepdad recently put up new cameras outside so I didn’t see anything wrong with him positioning one outside my window. Come to find out the very next day, I had my boyfriend stay over and he found that the surveillance camera that was ran from outside my window and into my room was being powered by one of those spy camera power blocks. 

For context, my relationship with my stepdad hasn’t always been the best and we tend to butt heads a lot. He’s said a lot of questionable things in the past that i’ve written off because he’s my dad and i would never think he intended to be inappropriate or harmful. He’s been in my life since i was 8 years old. Of course I’m second guessing everything now that i’ve found this camera. It was positioned to point directly at my bedroom door from the far wall, so it has direct view of my entire room, which i change in. 

I tried desperately to rationalize it and think it was maybe a mistake, like he grabbed the wrong charger box. Or maybe he was just trying to look for intruders. But really there is no excuse for putting a camera in MY bedroom. the camera even had an SD card in it. I’m beyond devastated. My stepdad even suggested i invite my boyfriend over to while they’re gone so i have someone here, which is something he would never do considering he’s made it clear before he doesn’t want him over when no one is home because he doesn’t want us ‘fucking in his home’. My boyfriend and I are going to go through the SD card to see if there is anything on it.

I’m at a complete loss at how to even bring this up to my mom. I confided in my aunt and uncle since they live close by and they have been very supportive of me having a conversation with my mom about it. This whole situation is extremely upsetting, I at least have some family to support me as i navigate this but i don’t even know how to bring this up to my mom. This is obviously going to change everything. She had my five year old half brother with him. 

My mind is racing with the consequences this is going to have on our family. Has anyone that has been in a similar situation have advice? How can i do this without causing extreme damage to the family (although that may be impossible). Thank you in advance.

TLDR; i found a hidden camera that my stepdad put in my room, how do i bring this up to my mom?

UPDATE(1/?):

I don’t want to make a whole new thread since i want to make a new update when my parents get back monday, but i want to thank everyone for all the advice. i went to the police station tonight and filed a police report and turned in the spy camera with the SD card. The officer said this is a serious offense and i will likely get a call early next week from an investigator due to the severity of the situation. I’m planning on telling my mother about the police report after we have a conversation about this on monday, with my aunt and uncle present. 

As for people messaging me about my profile: thank you for reminding me to delete personal information. Please please do not dox or try to seek any sort of justice for me as this may affect my case. Respect my privacy during this time please as it may be crucial during this investigation.

This was the hardest thing i ever had to do, but whatever this shit was, it’s ending with me. I hope i can get justice for myself and any other victims who may have been violated by him since this will be heavily investigated and the officer said it will likely be looked into further (such as search warrants and looking for more SD cards). i’m hanging on by a thread but the support i have is what’s keeping me together. i’m staying with my boyfriend tonight to keep out of the house. Thanks again for all the love and supportive messages. I’ll update again soon.

UPDATE (2/?)

it’s the next morning and once my boyfriend wakes up we’re going back to my house today to look for any more secret cameras (either in the bathroom or my brothers rooms) so i can submit it for more evidence. i’m iffy about searching my parents room for more evidence as it’s likely he has a hidden camera in there to see me do it. still on the fence about having a police officer search the house, if i do i’ll be sure to update after i’m finished and in a safe place. my aunt has offered to come with me to help me search.

again, thank you everyone for the support. i’m trying as best i can to do this the right way and get as much done with the time i have left. i’m mentally and emotionally drained but i’ll be seeking resources once all of this is said and done. i’m reading everyone’s comments so i’m taking all the advice i can get.

UPDATE (3/?)

i probably won’t be able to update for a few days since today is the day that i talk to my mom, but i just wanted to share the plan i made and hopes for what happens today.

after talking with my aunt, uncle, boyfriend, and my cousin who is a civil lawyer, i’ve decided that i will speak to my mom in a separate location from my stepdad. most likely i’ll have her meet me somewhere outside of our home. i’ll have my aunt with me and this is where i’ll explain everything to her: the camera, past uncomfortable experiences i’ve had with my stepdad that i originally brushed off because he was my dad, video footage of him deliberately setting it up and angling it, and footage of me in my room. im praying she understands why i had to go to my aunt instead of her considering she was not in town and i was worried for her safety if i told her what happened. (she was stuck with him and my brothers about 4 hours away for the weekend) 

i’m hoping with my aunt there and her being away from my stepdad that it’ll prevent her from reacting out of anger and search for him and escalate the situation then and there, and i hope my aunt can provide some support for myself and her. i’m prepared for her to go through the same processes i went through such as reasoning and denial, but with the evidence there’s no possible way she can deny it. i’m preparing myself for the worst. i just hope that i can be strong for her and support her as this all hits her like it did me. 

i will not be returning home or facing him today. my boyfriend will be on standby to pick up my brothers if needed since my aunt has offered for them to stay with us so my mom can talk to my stepdad without them there. i’ll ask my mom to meet me and of course, not tell my stepdad about the circumstances. maybe she can tell him she’s going to the grocery store. i don’t want him getting any hints that she could be meeting
with me. 

i know i’ve said it a lot but i truly do appreciate the support system i have not only with my family but here too. this has been a nightmare but hearing everyone’s stories about this, proving it’s way too common, is what is helping me get through this and pushing me to do the right thing. not only am i a victim in this but my boyfriend as well and god knows who else. the confrontation won’t happen for about another 7 hours so i’m the meantime i’ll be reading over comments and preparing myself for what comes today. thank you guys.","Original Post:

Content: Having a preference isnt the same as a fetish. Someone with a fetish only dates a person because that person is asian. Not because they like the person, just because they fit the fetish.

Do other things do it for you too? Do you also like the person for reasons that arent their ethnicity?

I live with a partner with whom we are not a couple and we practice sexworking together and independently. Our lives are very much connected and interdepended. They pay for rent, amenities etc. I offer tech support, emotional support, taking photos, resolving issues they wouldn’t.. they invited me to have this type of domestic economy. One day they told me to act together on camera for a client. We have worked together before but it never felt as it should and we had discussed about it, even though we are both functional and well received as performers separately. There was never a conversation about me owing anything for the access to house spaces etc to do escorting, I was always welcome to do so. 

So, that day, they approach me for that double camera session and they knew my requested gift for that but suggested a lower price. I named my regular price 240 but said that I would do it for 200. I was already ready for action i didn’t want to overthink it. (I do this for the money ofc but I also really enjoy it) We did a gig for 600 in total. And right after it was over the client asked to go for more via DMs. We said 200 extra (the amount of the gift depends on the duration). So because the allowance was sent to my account and I was transferring to theirs I was about to send them 100 at that point and they asked me for 50 more. I was puzzled and asked what for and they attacked me on the grounds of them helping me financially many times and didn’t want me to react to their request this way because it was just 50 and they shouldn’t have to explain because of the nature/dynamics of our relationship. I was already thinking of leaving money after the gig for the house, which i also have done multiple times before and i was buying food after every session i had, I knew I was not someone who doesn’t like to take to advantage of other people’s work and I thought we had an agreement. Anyway, I told them that what they say is valid but I didn’t want to deal with that a minute after we finished our session and were waiting for the client to send more to start again as sex is a very sensitive time for me and my feelings especially when we do it together. They said that life is fast and like that and I cannot react this way because this is business. I sent 150. They client never sent more money so in the end I had 150 and they had 450 from that gig of 600 in total. And that didn’t feel good at all.

I have access to their dms, with their permission in case they want me to do sexting session for them, which has happened many times and I take that money. they just don’t want to lose clients if they are preoccupied. I accessed the dms because I could not stop thinking whether I was raped or not, wether they knew that that extra 200 were not gonna happen when they asked me to send the 150. They really didn’t. But I could not talk about this after the attack on my ethics. For the last months we have been feeling our relationship is toxic. They have accused me of taking financial advantage of them, of not being able to trust me but I also feel the same way (regardless of the incident). I know they didn’t think about the imbalance of our earnings that night but I am not sure if they used my vulnerability in sex to monitor me or figure me out which is definitely not something I have consented to. They know me very well, they see things in me I was not able to acknowledge. They know how to utilise sex in their favour and I have never seen them being genuinely happy when I achieve things in the field like good customers etc. Once a customer they knew booked me and in one conversation they mentioned it was their client to reinforce their narrative about an argument so I know they weren’t happy. One other time a very good customer of them also approached me and the day after i informed them about it they said he also texted them and we should a gig together. I was like i think we should do separate gigs with him and the customer never replied back to me when he was really enthusiastic before. I cannot know if they did something there but I have a bad feeling as they day after that their dms account was unlinked from my device.

Bottom line after context, i know this relationship is toxic, but if they engage with my sexuality in a non consensual way is this domestic sexual assault? I have explained clearly and many times I do sexwork to practice with my body, that I evolve through this process, that I have chosen it for a number of reasons including reclaiming my identity and sexual confidence. Was I sexually assaulted when they asked for that money if I know there is spite against me and i know they know my vulnerabilities specifically when we act together?

Content: This is a really tricky one. For me I’d say that it would fall under the banner of informed consent, in the sense that you agreed to have sex for a specific price and then you were pressured into giving away your money. Ie you didn’t consent to sex in that context for less money. It definitely falls under the banner of financial coercion though- them pressuring you for money isn’t cool at all. If they wanted more money that should have been a separate conversation outside of aex. The fact that they told you you’d get paid a specific amount, then pressured you out of the money suggests to me that this was a deliberate act, as they knew you would be easy to manipulate. I’m really sorry this happened to you.

Content: This is a tough situation...

Legally, I'm not sure this would qualify as sexual assault.  It might under the 'if you're under the influence you can't legally consent' doctrine but that's iffy.  From what you said, you never actually said 'no' or 'I don't want to'.  And you could make the argument that you were coerced but he can simply say he had no way of knowing that or about your drug interaction, you seemed into it.  

Ethically though, I think it qualifies as assault (or at least as abuse).  If you were that far gone it's unlikely that you were very coherent or talkative, and if he was driving drunk that's also a bad thing.  

I think the most important thing though (and I think this is what you're sort of asking) is I don't think you are responsible for what happened.  If there is a drug interaction that caused you to get far more drunk than usual, to the point that you don't even remember what happened, that's not your fault.  

I would however suggest maybe don't hang out with those friends much again.  Leaving without you is not the kind of thing a good friend does.  I can say for me personally if I see a friend (of either gender) getting wasted when we're out, I'm going to make damn sure they either get home safely or specifically want me to leave without them.

title, basically. here’s the context: 

i am a minor, 14 at the time this happened, & i went on a camping trip with my friend & his family. His mom’s best friend was also there. I feel like i should mention that I’m female.

title, basically. here’s the context: 

i am a minor, 14 at the time this happened, & i went on a camping trip with my friend & his family. His mom’s best friend was also there. I feel like i should mention that I’m female.

They were about rape and fear of being a pedophile and got really bad, i had so much fear of being a pedophile at that age and even felt scared and guilt about my parents finding out about me when something abt pedophilia was on tv and they watched it and my intrusive thoughts about raping my usually male friends tormented me, fast forward some years, i was about 15 and a man sexually assaulted me, he touched me and stuff, and in that exact moment i remember not just feeling terrified but like it was okay, as if it was okay this happened and i was ""comfortable"" with it, like i knew what to do, its only now i realize what this feeling was. I also remember for almost as long as i know that i was really deeply ashamed of my body and never wanted to take my shirt off or show my legs, i also became more and more alone from age 10 and i remember 1 time when i was bed wetting at an older age, like 8 or 9 or so and thinking ""why does this happen?""  because i knew i was too old for that. I have always felt really weird about being myself and never knew why.

Am i making this all up? Or mixing it with other stuff like my father beating my moms head into the wall or screaming at me? Do my now traumas make me believe there was something bc i supress them? 

I also have moments in which i deeply resonate with hearing about childhood sexual trauma, but i dont know if i really do so or if its just my now trauma making me understand it.

Content: From what you described about being scared of being a pedophile, it sounds a lot like OCD to me. But then you also describe bed wetting and resonating with CSA stories. No one on Reddit can tell you for certain if you were SAd as a child, that’s something only your memory can do, or a trauma therapist. If you’re worried I’d recommend finding a professional to talk to, and maybe look into OCD as well, to see if that resonates. Wish you all the best.

Author: hardmenchocker66
Content: Hey, yes i also think OCD was definetely the case for me, i used to always be forced to tap 5 times with my fingers, or move my lips 5 or 7 times. I just dont know whats wrong, i dont even know if it happened because 1 time somebody told me about them getting raped and it felt foreign to me hearing about it, another time it felt like i was getting a flash of very deep feelings, but as everything it changes everyday and i have a really bad sense of time. I will try to find a professional to find out more, i want to, its just difficult to tell that to my mother because i dont know how to explain it to her. Thank you for your response! I wish you the best too:)

We were invited to this party and I had wayyy too much to drink on an empty stomach. He drank too but he was good enough to drive me home. I don't remember much of the night, only bits and pieces but I know that I had lost my virginity. I know that it happened I just don't remember it.

It hurts me that he brushed it off and made me feel like I was being dramatic.
I wouldn't call it rape because knowing me when I get drunk I make stupid impulsive decisions, I probably asked him for it. I just hate that he agreed fully knowing I would never agree to it sober.

5 months ago, I (19F) and my ex boyfriend (20M) had only officially been together for about two weeks and had been regularly having sex.

Title: Was this sexual assault?
Body: I came to Reddit to ask for any outsiders' opinions on whether this was sexual assault or not.

5 months ago, I (19F) and my ex boyfriend (20M) had only officially been together for about two weeks and had been regularly having sex. I came over to his place and we hung out for a few hours until he got a message from some friends asking if he wanted to get drunk and hang out.

I have so many thoughts and feelings, so thanks for understanding any poor grammar or anything in this rant.

&#x200B;

Yesterday I went to an asian massage parlor that I've been to many times before. Usually, I do a cheap fully clothed reflexology massage, but yesterday I decided to treat myself to a full body 90 min massage.   I've gotten massages many times before and am very comfortable with getting my body touched and am ok with getting my butt massaged.

&#x200B;

When I first arrived, they took me to a room where I quickly got undressed, everything except my underwear under the sheets.  I was wearing glasses that day, so I took those off too, so my vision was very impaired, which is fine because my eyes are closed the whole time. The man working started working on my neck shoulders, backs, buttocks and legs. He started to massage my butt over the sheets and I was fine with it. I've gotten massages before and they've massaged my butt in the past, so that didn't seem out of the ordinary. Everything seemed fine, except for when he was massaging my butt, my underwear was rubbing against my skin and it made me feel itchy. (This is where I fucked up). I told him that was happening and asked if I could remove my underwear. I kept the sheet over me the whole time and then we were back to normal. He continued the massage as normal and at the time, it felt mostly normal. Looking back, there are a few things that I thought were weird , but  I didn't feel crazy uncomfortable at the time.

&#x200B;

I then rotated to massage the front side. He massaged my face and then the shoulders again. He then asked me if I wanted oil or lotion. I was like whatever you've been doing this whole time?  He covers my face with a towel and proceeds to start massaging my shoulders and then works his way down to my arms.  He massaging my legs and starts inching closer to my pubic area. This is when things start getting weird, I'm wondering if he's getting kind of close and at points, I'm honestly even slightly aroused, but I'm thinking, he's a professional, there's no way that this is happening and thought it was all in my head.  He kind of stops that area and then moves back to chest and removes the towel from my breasts to that I'm fully exposed. I'm alarmed, but just so shocked that this is happening to do anything. He moves back to my legs and sticks his fingers in my vagina. What the fuck is this really happening? Why am I not stopping him? What is going on? After a few seconds, I can't believe I took me this long, I motioned his arm away and use the towels to cover my chest.   He continues to massage my legs and then finally I just got the courage to tell him I need to stop and grab the towel, wrap it around my body, and ask him to leave. He just keeps pointing at something and saying something over and over and I'm not understanding, i just want to go. He then finally grabs a wet towel and says, towel for the oil. He tries to wrap it over and I'm just like no, I can do this myself. He quickly hands me a few more towels and leaves as I quickly dress and try get the fuck out of there.

&#x200B;

As I leave, I told the front desk guy that I'm not paying for anything and that was unacceptable. I couldn't get the courage to tell him what happened and just left.  Moments later, I get to the car and I call him back and told him that the masseuse touched me inappropriately and that they need to do something about it. He apologized, but I was too pissed to see if that was even sincere.  I managed to call back later and asked for the masseuse's name and license number, they gave it to me, and then quickly hung up.

&#x200B;

Since then, Ive been racking my brain about this whole situation. I feel so much shame and guilt. I feel like I let myself be in this situation. I should have stopped him when things were getting weird, but I didn't. Was I asking for this because I was slightly aroused? Not by him personally, but like someone is touching your leg? I have a boyfriend, how is this going to affect him? How is he going to be hurt to know this happened? I don't know. I know what everyone is going to say, but I can't help but just feel like it's my fault. I thought that if I was in a situation like this, I would know how to speak up. Why didn't I feel outraged as this was happening? I thought that I would know and feel extremely violated, but was I just in extreme shock?  I took off my underwear during the massage, that wasn't fucking smart. What the fuck was I thinking?? I don't know what to do. I know everyone's going to say to file a report or whatever, but what happens after that?  Halp.","Original Post:

Content: That's not rape or coercing. Don't listen to the idiots here. They are eager to call anything they can as rape.



In that scenario you didn't withdraw consent, you only expressed dissatisfaction with the experience.




You need to actually say no.



That being said your bf seems like an ass and I wouldn't put up with that.

Comment (depth 1):
Author: _lost_in_thoughts_
Content: Saying ""I'm not in the mood anymore"" is 100% a withdrawal of consent. 

You do not have to say ""no"" to withdrawal or not give consent. There are many ways to say you do not consent, such as: 

I'm not in the mood. 

I don't really want to.

I don't feel good. 

I'm not really sure. 

I don't know. 

And the list goes on. OP also said she was crying. That in itself means they want you to stop. 

Saying you have to say ""no"" to revoke or not give consent is used to justify rape/sexual assault because the victim ""didn't say no.""

Comment (depth 2):
Author: Bartimaeus222
Content: No it's not. It depends on the nature of your relationship. People aren't in the mood for a lot of things but still volountarily do it.


I missed the part with crying.


The guy is a asshole, it's not rape though.


No, they consented and didn't withdraw. It's not the same thing as knocking someone out and saying it's okay because they aren't saying no.

Comment (depth 3):
Author: _lost_in_thoughts_
Content: No it's not the same as knocking someone out, but ""they didn't say no"" *is* an excuse people use to justify sexual assault. Even if the person was awake during the attack. 

Yes, people do things they don't want to do, but when it comes to sex, that should not be the case. It does not depend on the ""nature of your relationship,"" as marital rape is a thing and is fairly common. 

I will not argue about this. Please educate yourself on what consent is.

Comment (depth 4):
Author: Bartimaeus222
Content: Your desires on should are not relevant.


This is the standard for consent now. You don't get to change the rules and retroactively call people rapists because they aren't mind readers.



If I'm having sex and my girl wants to sit on my face she can. If I want that to stop I have to say so, I don't just let it happen and call it rape.


You people are dumb as shit.

Comment (depth 5):
Author: _lost_in_thoughts_
Content: If a girl is sitting on your face, and you say, ""I'd like you to get off my face,"" or ""could you get off my face"", or simply ""get off my face,"" that means you do not want her to be on your face and she, assuming she's a decent human being, will understand that you no longer consent to her being on your face and get off. Because what you said, equates to saying no. 

The ""standard of consent"" is *enthusiastic* consent. She was not enthusiastic. She said she wasn't in the mood. She straight up said she didn't want to have sex (which literally means no). She even cried. And he continued. That was coercion. 

Have a nice night, and once again, please educate yourself on what consent is.

Comment (depth 6):
Author: Bartimaeus222
Content: You are making different statements. Get off my face is a command, I'm not enjoying this is not.


That's not a standard. I don't have to ecstatic if my girl wants to hook up. I decide what is okay for myself. You don't get to tell me I was raped because of your new subjective standard.


You need to learn what words mean. Consent is explicit. Your standard is subjective to your opinion.

I’m now 16(f) but when I was around 12 or 13 I went to a sleepover, there were 6 girls there(including me). The girl whose house it was was extremely open as lesbian and of course we were all completely fine with that because she’s our friend. We were in her bedroom which was literally just a mattress on the floor and a tv. A few hours before, she’d had an argument with the rest of the girls as they’d gone to the shop late at night when she told them not to (I was the only one who stayed at her house with her when the rest went to the shop) so she let me lay on the mattress with her, while the other girls were on the floor. We were both facing right while laying down, until she turns around so that she’s facing me, our faces are really close together and she seems like she’s trying to get comfortable, it’s rlly hard to explain. I was fully awake and so was she, she then slid her hand up my pajama top and under my bra and layed her hand on my chest.(Not trying to be tmi but I went through puberty pretty early, probably when i was around 8 so my chest was more developed than most girls there, which made this even more uncomfortable for me) At this point I really didn’t know what to do as I, 1)never showed any interest in her in that way, and 2)everyone was surrounding us yet nobody had seen it happen so they couldn’t get her off me. Even though I was a lot bigger than her I just completely froze and didn’t know what to do until I got the courage to take her hand out of my top, she kind of groaned in a way that sounded annoyed that i was doing that but I still managed to get her hand out. I then turned to face the other way and went to sleep. It wasn’t until the next morning when I was leaving that I realised what she had done might be counted as sexual assault. I really don’t know if it was though because I never even tried to tell her no, I just froze, although she fully knew what sexual assault was as she said her ex girlfriend had done it to her, so this is where i get conflicted as I can’t blame our young age because she was fully aware, but I never actually said no, plus I don’t even know if it’s possible for me as a girl to be sexually assaulted by another girl who’s actually a few months younger than me.
I just needed to get this off my chest to people who may be able to help me understand what happened as it’s been stuck on my mind for years and years and always makes me nauseous at the thought of it.

Also, just to clarify, she has never ever mentioned it since so i’ve come to believe that it was so insignificant to her that she can’t even remember it happening. ","Original Post:

A few hours before, she’d had an argument with the rest of the girls as they’d gone to the shop late at night when she told them not to (I was the only one who stayed at her house with her when the rest went to the shop) so she let me lay on the mattress with her, while the other girls were on the floor. We were both facing right while laying down, until she turns around so that she’s facing me, our faces are really close together and she seems like she’s trying to get comfortable, it’s rlly hard to explain. I was fully awake and so was she, she then slid her hand up my pajama top and under my bra and layed her hand on my chest.(Not trying to be tmi but I went through puberty pretty early, probably when i was around 8 so my chest was more developed than most girls there, which made this even more uncomfortable for me) At this point I really didn’t know what to do as I, 1)never showed any interest in her in that way, and 2)everyone was surrounding us yet nobody had seen it happen so they couldn’t get her off me. Even though I was a lot bigger than her I just completely froze and didn’t know what to do until I got the courage to take her hand out of my top, she kind of groaned in a way that sounded annoyed that i was doing that but I still managed to get her hand out. I then turned to face the other way and went to sleep. It wasn’t until the next morning when I was leaving that I realised what she had done might be counted as sexual assault. I really don’t know if it was though because I never even tried to tell her no, I just froze, although she fully knew what sexual assault was as she said her ex girlfriend had done it to her, so this is where i get conflicted as I can’t blame our young age because she was fully aware, but I never actually said no, plus I don’t even know if it’s possible for me as a girl to be sexually assaulted by another girl who’s actually a few months younger than me.
I just needed to get this off my chest to people who may be able to help me understand what happened as it’s been stuck on my mind for years and years and always makes me nauseous at the thought of it.

Also, just to clarify, she has never ever mentioned it since so i’ve come to believe that it was so insignificant to her that she can’t even remember it happening.

Content: It sounds like your cleavage,it would be right between your breasts. This is a sexual area without permission, so that would fall under sexual assault. If she touched the breasts with her hand between that clearly is sexual assault. (both are but a sexual body parts is an easier call than a part adjacent, but under a bra is pretty personal.

So, yes. It sounds like she made a move without consent and was upset you rejected her. She should know better.","Information support, Esteem support",True,Decent_Discussion847,0,Starfury7-Jaargen,False,,Information support,title_only,YES,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO

Hi there,

I’ve been dating my boyfriend for nearly 7 months. I’ve always been aware of his manipulative behaviours and have always pulled him up on them. Even when he has changed them, I’ve always been worried he’d adapt in another way. 

Last night I went to a party with him with my friends. We got drunk, him more so. I made it specifically clear at the start (when sober) to not do anything or try anything. This is a huge boundary for me since I have been in a horrible situation with my past boyfriend, and it obviously made me very hyperaware and cautious. My current boyfriend knew of what happened as well, and seemed very caring to catering to my trauma.

Throughout the night, he kept fondling me and groping me- even when I yelled no and pushed him off. He also, kept trying to make out with me, even when I told him no. He would hold my head and not allow me to pull back, even though I  managed to every time. He kept on sexually touching me for HOURS and it got to a point where I plead with him to stop. He would repetitively shove his hands down my pants. At the end, I once again pushed him off when he tried to force himself on me, and he ran away crying. My friends told me he was hysterical, so I went up to him. He basically outlined that I was neglecting his needs and he didn’t feel loved since I didn’t want to give him physical affection. He made it out to me being wrong and cruel for not giving him what he wanted. I apologised, feeling awfully bad, and he tried INSTANTLY again after. 

He knows that I have deep-rooted trauma about this specific area, which makes me even more upset. I’m not sure If I am overreacting or that my emotions are actually reasonable. I feel so used, and hurt. I’m not sure what to do. When asked about it- when he approached my friend the day after, he said he did it because he was in a ‘bad mind set’ and ‘anxious’, and he really needed physical affection (since he claims that is his love language). However, I’m not entirely sure how forcing yourself on someone, for HOURS, and being yelled to stop- is love language?

I guess I really had to get this off my chest. One part of me is belittling myself for being upset- and subliminally saying its not a big deal. Meanwhile, another part is extremely hurt and upset with his actions. I’d really like to hear an outside perspective of this.","Original Post:

I just wanted some closure as to whether or not I experienced sexual assault, or just grew up in an ignorant household. I am 24, unemployed, and still live at home.

I've had some odd experiences growing up (at least I question them now), and I wanted to make sure my feelings were legitimate. Here's some things I grew up with:

-My dad would let me bathe with him when I was about 3.

-When I was a bit older, I saw my father peeing in the bathroom. I didn't really understand what a penis was, so I asked if I could touch it. He agreed, and I did. Then I giggled and ran away shortly after.

-My father also likes to tap my ass/lower waist when he wants to acknowledge me. I've brought up to him that I didn't like it in front of my mom, and he told me, ""Well, it develops character."" He still touches my butt every once in a while. Sometimes if I see he's behind me coming up the stairs, I walk up faster so he won't do it.


I told my therapist all this when I was 18. I didn't tell her any earlier in fears that I would be forced into foster care--leaving behind everything I knew. She told me if I were younger, she would have to report it and I would, in fact, be placed in foster care because my mom wouldn't be able to take care of me. My father probably would have been a registered sex offender and lost his pension. If I said anything when I was under 18, it would have tarnished our family's reputation and our income.

My therapist also talks to my mom, and I gave her permission to talk to her about it since I was too afraid to say something myself. This eventually became a weird forced conversation to her when we went for a walk at a local park. It made me feel uncomfortable because I wasn't fully ready to talk to her about it. I don't think I ever will. My mom heard my stories, but didn't do anything about it. It makes me feel like what I've experienced wasn't really a big deal.

I always thought my dad was a creepy guy, but I'm afraid that it may be a little bit more than creepy. Am I crazy, or are the situations really damaging?","Original Post:

It has been perhaps a month since it happened but I can’t stop thinking about it - my male friend was standing in front of me, a bit to the side, and somehow (I wasn’t looking in his direction so I couldn’t exactly see) tripped and his hand bashed my breast. After this, he muttered a ”Hm. Whoops.” And faced The other direction while we waited for our bus. He didn’t look shocked but he also didn’t look entertained. Just a blank-ish expression with his mouth open a bit - not much emotion going on.

He had never done anything like this before. And I don’t understand how he could’ve tripped. He was standing perfectly fine on a flat concrete surface that had nothing he could trip over on it but somehow went close enough to me and landed on my chest and seemingly grabbed my  breast?? We always keep some distance so we aren’t touching as I usually like having a lot of personal space. He had also been facing forwards so I don’t understand how the process of his body twisting nearly 180 to face me happened. This was a complete shock. My breast was sore for about half an hour afterwards. No one has ever touched me in that location before.   


This was essentially one of the last interactions we have had (all that have followed are him looking at me while we were in line for coffee/drinks then acting like he didn’t see me and his friends walking past with him and they said hello). He is also in a relationship now - I don’t want to cause any trouble.   


He hasn’t really given a proper apology but I haven’t asked for one or even addressed it. But I dont see him much anymore so I haven’t had the chance and now it feels too late. I was just really shocked and confused. Does this count as SA or anything? I hope not - I don’t think I’m part of the 97%  but I’m not really sure what counts.

Content: Going off the information given this seems like a complete accident and should be forgotten about, probably even laughed about. 

Feeling a breast and bashing one so hard you're sore for an hour are very different things. Random losses of balance happen. Seems like he's moved on and has no history of being weird. I do think he should issue a better apology but honestly sounds like he's so embarrassed he's just trying to hope it goes away.

Content: If you lose consciousness at any point, say no, try to stop him, try to move away from him, etc., it is sexual assault. Anything that indicates you can’t continue to consent or have stopped consenting is sexual assault. He also fed you more alcohol when you didn’t want more, he was intentionally trying to get you so drunk you wouldn’t be able to consent. He raped you. I am so, so sorry. What you’re describing is deeply horrific and incredibly disturbing. He had no reason to do this so it means he wanted to rape you. Please break up with him at the very least and if you feel strong enough go to the police. Your boyfriend is dangerous. Do not see him again and cut all contact. I promise you, he is a horrible person.","Information support, Emotional support, Esteem support",True,AdSignal589,0,peachsandwich,False,,"Information support, Emotional support",title_only,YES,YES,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO

I couldn’t go on the trip since i had work, so i was staying home to house sit and feed our animals. My stepdad recently put up new cameras outside so I didn’t see anything wrong with him positioning one outside my window. Come to find out the very next day, I had my boyfriend stay over and he found that the surveillance camera that was ran from outside my window and into my room was being powered by one of those spy camera power blocks. 

For context, my relationship with my stepdad hasn’t always been the best and we tend to butt heads a lot. He’s said a lot of questionable things in the past that i’ve written off because he’s my dad and i would never think he intended to be inappropriate or harmful. He’s been in my life since i was 8 years old. Of course I’m second guessing everything now that i’ve found this camera. It was positioned to point directly at my bedroom door from the far wall, so it has direct view of my entire room, which i change in. 

I tried desperately to rationalize it and think it was maybe a mistake, like he grabbed the wrong charger box. Or maybe he was just trying to look for intruders. But really there is no excuse for putting a camera in MY bedroom. the camera even had an SD card in it. I’m beyond devastated. My stepdad even suggested i invite my boyfriend over to while they’re gone so i have someone here, which is something he would never do considering he’s made it clear before he doesn’t want him over when no one is home because he doesn’t want us ‘fucking in his home’. My boyfriend and I are going to go through the SD card to see if there is anything on it.

I’m at a complete loss at how to even bring this up to my mom. I confided in my aunt and uncle since they live close by and they have been very supportive of me having a conversation with my mom about it. This whole situation is extremely upsetting, I at least have some family to support me as i navigate this but i don’t even know how to bring this up to my mom. This is obviously going to change everything. She had my five year old half brother with him. 

My mind is racing with the consequences this is going to have on our family. Has anyone that has been in a similar situation have advice? How can i do this without causing extreme damage to the family (although that may be impossible). Thank you in advance.

TLDR; i found a hidden camera that my stepdad put in my room, how do i bring this up to my mom?

UPDATE(1/?):

I don’t want to make a whole new thread since i want to make a new update when my parents get back monday, but i want to thank everyone for all the advice. i went to the police station tonight and filed a police report and turned in the spy camera with the SD card. The officer said this is a serious offense and i will likely get a call early next week from an investigator due to the severity of the situation. I’m planning on telling my mother about the police report after we have a conversation about this on monday, with my aunt and uncle present. 

As for people messaging me about my profile: thank you for reminding me to delete personal information. Please please do not dox or try to seek any sort of justice for me as this may affect my case. Respect my privacy during this time please as it may be crucial during this investigation.

This was the hardest thing i ever had to do, but whatever this shit was, it’s ending with me. I hope i can get justice for myself and any other victims who may have been violated by him since this will be heavily investigated and the officer said it will likely be looked into further (such as search warrants and looking for more SD cards). i’m hanging on by a thread but the support i have is what’s keeping me together. i’m staying with my boyfriend tonight to keep out of the house. Thanks again for all the love and supportive messages. I’ll update again soon.

UPDATE (2/?)

it’s the next morning and once my boyfriend wakes up we’re going back to my house today to look for any more secret cameras (either in the bathroom or my brothers rooms) so i can submit it for more evidence. i’m iffy about searching my parents room for more evidence as it’s likely he has a hidden camera in there to see me do it. still on the fence about having a police officer search the house, if i do i’ll be sure to update after i’m finished and in a safe place. my aunt has offered to come with me to help me search.

again, thank you everyone for the support. i’m trying as best i can to do this the right way and get as much done with the time i have left. i’m mentally and emotionally drained but i’ll be seeking resources once all of this is said and done. i’m reading everyone’s comments so i’m taking all the advice i can get.

UPDATE (3/?)

i probably won’t be able to update for a few days since today is the day that i talk to my mom, but i just wanted to share the plan i made and hopes for what happens today.

after talking with my aunt, uncle, boyfriend, and my cousin who is a civil lawyer, i’ve decided that i will speak to my mom in a separate location from my stepdad. most likely i’ll have her meet me somewhere outside of our home. i’ll have my aunt with me and this is where i’ll explain everything to her: the camera, past uncomfortable experiences i’ve had with my stepdad that i originally brushed off because he was my dad, video footage of him deliberately setting it up and angling it, and footage of me in my room. im praying she understands why i had to go to my aunt instead of her considering she was not in town and i was worried for her safety if i told her what happened. (she was stuck with him and my brothers about 4 hours away for the weekend) 

i’m hoping with my aunt there and her being away from my stepdad that it’ll prevent her from reacting out of anger and search for him and escalate the situation then and there, and i hope my aunt can provide some support for myself and her. i’m prepared for her to go through the same processes i went through such as reasoning and denial, but with the evidence there’s no possible way she can deny it. i’m preparing myself for the worst. i just hope that i can be strong for her and support her as this all hits her like it did me. 

i will not be returning home or facing him today. my boyfriend will be on standby to pick up my brothers if needed since my aunt has offered for them to stay with us so my mom can talk to my stepdad without them there. i’ll ask my mom to meet me and of course, not tell my stepdad about the circumstances. maybe she can tell him she’s going to the grocery store. i don’t want him getting any hints that she could be meeting
with me. 

i know i’ve said it a lot but i truly do appreciate the support system i have not only with my family but here too. this has been a nightmare but hearing everyone’s stories about this, proving it’s way too common, is what is helping me get through this and pushing me to do the right thing. not only am i a victim in this but my boyfriend as well and god knows who else. the confrontation won’t happen for about another 7 hours so i’m the meantime i’ll be reading over comments and preparing myself for what comes today. thank you guys.","Original Post:

Content: Definitely coercive behaviour, maybe she isn't aware and just sees it as rejection and convincing you. I wouldn't actually go so far as to say rape but clearly on the wrong side of the line. There must be a deeper problem within her and that is for therapists to work out.

Hi everyone, I’ve posted this in a few threads because I desperately need advice I need to know if I’m crazy for feeling like this 

I (f) have a friend (f) I’ve known for a while, and recently she told me she’s in love with me.
I don’t feel the same way at all, and ever since the confession things have started clicking into place in a way that’s making me feel sick.

Now that I’m looking back, a lot of her behaviour wasn’t “playful” or “quirky” & it feels sexual and predatory, and I genuinely didn’t consent to ANY of it.

Now that I replay everything with that context, I feel extremely uncomfortable, and honestly… violated.

Here are some of the behaviours that are now making my stomach turn:

	•	She will just start “play fighting” with me touching my breasts during. I always hated it and froze up, but she acted like it was joking around. I never consented to anything sexual.

	•	She has shown me explicit nudes and videos of herself on FaceTime via screen-share. I felt cornered because I knew if I didn’t react politely she’d be upset.& I just told myself that she just showed me that because she felt like she could trust me? But I would feel sick every time she’d show me. 

	•	One time when I using alcohol to cope and I was constantly drunk and vulnerable, I mentioned I had no money left for more alcohol. She offered to send me money if I showed her my vagina. At the time I thought she was joking, but I was drunk and I wanted to stay drunk. She sent the money. Now it feels… awful.
	•	She has asked me multiple times if she can perform oral sex on me, saying she wants to “make me feel good.” Every time I say no, she starts shaking, crying, or having a panic response saying she feels ugly and unworthy.

	•	She copies me constantly. My scent, my clothes, certain things that I say, almost like she’s trying to become me.

	•	She gets jealous and competitive any time a man shows interest in me, or even when I’m talking about someone else.

	•	She’s overly touchy, even though she knows I’m autistic with hypersensitivity to touch and I always tell her I don’t like being touched. 

	•	She once showed me an explicit porn video (two women scissoring) on FaceTime despite knowing I hate porn. She forcibly shared her screen and I couldn’t stop it. That’s the only time she ever apologised because I lost it with her I was so angry that time. 

	•	She keeps bringing up her feelings, even after telling me she wouldn’t. It’s like she wants me to hold her emotional burden.

	•	She has said things like “if my life doesn’t improve next year, I’ll end it,” which makes me feel trapped and responsible for her stability.

What’s really messing with my head is that I told myself it was harmless or that she didn’t mean it that way, but the confession made me realise that NONE of this came from a platonic place.

I feel violated and uncomfortable in my own body now. I don’t want her touching me, talking sexually near me, sending me sexual content, or “play fighting” with me ever again. I also don’t feel safe rejecting her because she has panic attacks and emotional breakdowns anytime she’s crossed my boundaries and I tell her that.

I’m scared to end the friendship because I don’t want to be alone, but I’m realising this friendship isn’t safe or healthy for me.

Is this sexual assault? Has anyone been through something similar? How do I end this without her spiralling? I just need to hear from other survivors because I feel incredibly confused and gross right now.","Original Post:

I'll try and make this short. Went out with friends, got very drunk, lost friends, ended up going to a bar.

About the my dad thing. He has gone from almost despising her existence to welcoming her, and my mum really likes her too. I feel like I'm in too deep and its scary to get out. Not only because of the judgement by my parents but because I do love her.

What you're saying is right though. I just don't know how to end something that is actually good. She makes me happy and its hard to let her go. We've both got a lot going on at the moment and we both want to go into professional careers so there's no knowing where we will end up. I just feel this immense pressure to not break her heart.

Ill try and put a decent tl;dr at the end.

I will begin by saying that the reason that the title says 'girlfriend' is because we aren't actually together. We are 'seeing each other' basically because I have commitment issues. We have been in this situation since around July. Henceforth in this post I will refer to her as Sandra.

My comittment issues mainly stem from my previous reasonably long term relationship between age 15 and 17. The whole ordeal of the messy horrible breakup kind of stayed with me since then and I haven't been able to commit to anyone since. I did date someone for a little while but then broke it off.

Me and Sandra met online in June but didn't actually meet in person until September. From July we were 'exclusively seeing each other' which were my terms because I didn't want to commit to someone over the internet. She was pretty intent on being together after about a week which probably should have been a big warning sign for me. She knew about my commitment issues and id told her it could be a long time until we actually got together.

She came and stayed for the weekend and she got quite upset saying that I will never want to be with her properly and I felt really bad. Every time I want to make it official I just can't do it. We are practically together yet there is something about the title that scares me. She is a really great girl and I love her to bits but there of course are things about her that I'm not so keen on.

I spoke to my dad recently about her and said that I'm not sure if I want to be in a relationship right now and I don't know if I want to be in one going into university. He basically told me not to mess her around so I feel pressured by him to get with her even if its not what I want. Sandra knows that I'm not sure if I want a relationship going into uni and get upset yet quickly carried on believing we would last forever.

I've never been long distance so I wanted to give it a try and its been ok. I trust her a lot and I've had freedom when she's not around. My issue is that of we stayed together we wouldn't see each other regularly until at least 2018. I don't think I can do that. On top of this, becoming official feels too much for me but ending it cmpletely feels too extreme too. I know I can't keep myself or her in this limbo forever.

I guess what I'm asking is; should I end it on good terms? Should I make it official and see how it goes?

I know these are questions that no one can really answer except me but any guidance would be greatly appreciated. Even if I don't get any advice on here it feels good to finally get my thoughts on paper. This whole thing has been wearing me down mentally for a while. Thanks for the help.

Tl;dr have been 'seeing' Sandra for many months. Crunch time on whether to take the next step or not. I feel under pressure from family to take it further. I love her a lot yet can't bring myself to do it no matter how hard I try. Am I a victim of right person wrong time? What do you think I should do?","Original Post:

Content: You're 19, and the fact that you know you're not ready to settle down is not a bad thing. Lots of people that age think they are, then 15 or so years later (if even that) they're in divorce court. 

> I spoke to my dad recently about her and said that I'm not sure if I want to be in a relationship right now and I don't know if I want to be in one going into university. He basically told me not to mess her around so I feel pressured by him to get with her even if its not what I want.

Reading that it sounds like your dad wants you to either commit or let her go. That's really the right thing to do here. And it sounds like you've already come to the decision that you aren't ready to commit. 

So, rather than leave the girl you love in this limbo land of ""will he or won't he"", maybe you should go ahead and let her go. You're both young, and perhaps later on things will come around and you'll both be ready to settle down. But don't feel like you have to marry this girl tomorrow. I think that would be the biggest mistake.

My English is a little bad so sorry in advance. I will try to give as much info needed as possible around when it happened since my situation is complicated in my opinion.

This happened at a party and me and a old friend 20F planned to attend a party at my house. A little backstory we have not talked in 6 months due to a fight we had prior but I decided talk again and fix things that night because of her [b](https://behavior.My)ehavior. My friend tends to be controlling in a way where she wont stop texting and trying to talk until you actually did. I didn't really think it was too bad until I thought about it over time but, to sum it up she would text me constantly and show up to my house unannounced in order to try to get me to forgive her. So when I did and we finished talking I went to her apartment so that she could get ready. I asked her if she wanted to sleep over since it would be extremely late and she was home alone that night, and she agreed. We both made it very clear that we didn't want to have sex with each other that night, me especially since we have been fighting the months prior. I don't remember too much and I don't know if you call it getting blacked out drunk since if I'm correct blackout means you don't remember anything at all and I think I remember some flashes.

 But when we woke up in the morning she told me that we kissed and touched last night but didn't mention sex at all. She seemed really happy since she told me that I ""really wanted it last night."" I asked her if she was ok since I didn't remember too much and she said she was. She told me she was happy since it meant I wasn't mad at her anymore. We spent the entire day together and she kept joking about what happened and being very specific about some things which made me uncomfortable but I just let it slide. But as evening approached I asked to leave and before I did I told her ""I didn't know what happened but if I hurt you at all. I'm sorry."" I do typically apologize a lot for some reason even though things aren't my fault I don't know why. But as soon as I texted her that, she immediately begins to blame me for what happened and told me that it was my fault. I got information from a friend of hers saying that everything that took place that night took and estimated 4 hours and that I was passing in and out while it was happening. I do remember flashes of her smiling and I remember she was on top of me at one point. I'm not a hundred percent sure if this is from what happened or just a hallucination these images are just the most vivid out of all things I try to reimagine that night. I felt pretty bad after hearing all this and felt worse when I found out she was sober when it was going on. Its a little complicated right now since we are in similar friend groups which is another reason I chose to talk to her. But its split down the middle.

So what I'm confused about is if this is sexual assault or not since her friends are saying that being drunk isn't an excuse while mine are saying drunk people cant consent, especially in a situation like this. As a side note I don't know who first initiated since people are saying that matters the most.","Original Post:

Content: First of all, no, it isn't assault. He obviously didn't mean to hurt you. 
I once had a friend that forced me to be physical with him so I understand how it makes you feel when people ignore a 'no' in such a situation and my current boyfriend does that a lot, too. So does that make it assault? No. In most cases, my bf thinks I'm not serious about the 'no' I gave him so he still tries. I think it might be the same with your bf since he stopped as soon as you signaled him that you rly didn't want him to do that.
Now for the advice: Talk about it. Make sure you tell him that with you, no *always* means no and that it will never be a joke or something. It's literally all you can do. If it happens more often and he doesn't respect your 'no' it'd be the best for you to take a break or break up.

Content: He has been upset because of this incident is very guilty now, he doesn't talk to me now ..Like before because he thinks he is not worthy of me and I tried talking to him, he clearly understands that no means a no,but now he keeps asking me ""what if it happens again?"" He is not able to forget what happened, he is not able to forgive himself.all of this makes it hard for me to handle the issue given that I'm also an amateur when it comes to relationship.

This happened back in early March/end of February and I didn’t really think about it until now. We were teens at the time.

So I had this friend and we’ll call him Ty. So Ty had invited me over because his parents weren’t home and I came over just to hang out cause we were decent friends. 

He had picked me up and then held me like I was a child and forced me to cuddle with him. He also later pinned me down on the ground trying to kiss me (the whole night he kept trying to kiss me) and I kept struggling to get out of his grip but he knew I wasn’t strong enough to push him off.

The only reason he got off was because his parents came back and he ended up pushing me out the side door and I walked home. 

There’s also this second guy who we’ll call Carlos. We were at a friends birthday party and he purposely tried picking me up for the sole purpose of grabbing my ass. Putting his hands there saying that he was “just trying to hold me up” and then later said that it was okay if I punched him for what he did.
