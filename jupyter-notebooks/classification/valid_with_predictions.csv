Content: I honestly have no idea, whether or not it counts as sexual assault, but I do know, i wouldn't touch anyone in that manner, unless I was already intimate with them, and it is something we normally do. As to me it seems too intimate to do.

With that said, I also wake up my kids that way sometimes. With the duvet/blanket between my hand and their body, so I place my hand on the lower back of their back if they lay on their stomach, or their hip, if they are laying sideways, and then I sort of bounce them like a basketball in their beds. 

For friends I'd at most nudge their shoulders, or poke their backs, again with the duvet/blanket between us.

I went on a tinder date to meet up with a guy who was both cute and friend of my coworker's. I have gone on plenty of Tinder dates before, but I felt like this one had a better chance of being good because of the mutual connection. I ended up having to work late, so I didn't meet up with him till late, but the vibe was calm and casual, not booty-call-esque. We had a drink and chatted about work and normal first date BS. Then we went to a jazz club and were really having a lot of fun. He was nice, funny, and I was having a great time. Being at a jazz club, we started chatting about our music tastes and agreed to go to his apartment nearby so we could share some favorites. 

At this point, I had no creepy vibe or uncomfortable feelings. I hadn't made any moves and neither had he in terms of sexual flirty stuff. So we got to his place and we started playing songs for each other and chatting some more. At some point, he pulled me closer to him and kissed me, which was an entirely welcome advance. So, we kissed for awhile and he gave me a back rub. It was late, probably about 2am, and he asked me to stay over. I hesitated, because I knew I didn't want to have sex, but decided to anyway for the draw of cuddling and making out. I told him then that I wasn't interested in having sex, which he was fine with. So, we climbed into bed and continued making out again. He started to make some moves and I stopped him and reminded him that I wasn't interested in having sex. He said okay and backed off again. So we keep making out and are getting pretty into it when suddenly I realize he's pulled his dick out. I was startled but didn't say anything. I didn't really know what to say. I wanted to leave at that point, but I just didn't know how to say ""Nope, I'm out."" So he tries to get me to jerk him off and I stop and say that I don't want to, which he sorta laughs and fakes being bummed about, then backs off again for a bit before doing it again. This continued, each time me stopping him when he started asking me to participate. At this point, I felt really uncomfortable and started to think that he was going to completely blow past me and just have sex with me. So, finally, he had his dick out again and was starting to try to pull my underwear off when I stopped him again and told him he really needed to stop that. So, he stopped and we ended up falling asleep. In the morning, there was some more of that before we finally got up and we got some coffee before parting. 

I'm torn. On one hand, he definitely ignored the vast majority of my pleas to stop. On the other hand, I didn't really forcefully stop him. I was more or less an active participant, at one point letting him put his penis between my thighs while he basically dry humped me. Some of it physically felt sorta good, despite the fact that I really didn't want to do anything sexual with that guy in that moment. 

I don't know how I feel about it. A little confused. Disappointed in myself for not jumping up and walking out the moment I felt uncomfortable. I don't feel particularly freaked out at all. I feel weirdly different, weirdly unsettled, but not scared or hurt or upset. If anything, I'm just upset that someone would so blatantly ignore what I had to say, especially since he had seemed so nice and normal all night before that. 

Any thoughts or bits of advice or pretty much anything would be helpful.

Content: No, it's a dating app. You can use it for hook ups, if that's your thing, but it is not exclusively for that purpose.

Comment (depth 2):
Author: tezzmosis
Content: Is it really? Only ever heard of it being a hook up app. I dated before Tindr, and even now if I had to date I can't see myself using it to find a serious date. Something a bit sleazy about being able to order a woman the same way you'd order a pizza. 

Don't meet up and take someone to bed if you don't want to sleep with them? I mean if you're already ordering a date like a hot pizza pie, shouldn't you have your intentions sorted out ahead of time? If you're making out and start taking clothes off, its sort of a mixed signal when you suddenly say stop. I've never had a girl say stop though, so maybe I'm biased.

That's not how the app works. It puts you in contact with people in your locality who find you mutually attractive based on their photos and profile. You can then exchange messages and if you like each other, agree to go on a date at a time convenient for you both. You can't just ""order a woman"".

I couldn’t go on the trip since i had work, so i was staying home to house sit and feed our animals. My stepdad recently put up new cameras outside so I didn’t see anything wrong with him positioning one outside my window. Come to find out the very next day, I had my boyfriend stay over and he found that the surveillance camera that was ran from outside my window and into my room was being powered by one of those spy camera power blocks. 

For context, my relationship with my stepdad hasn’t always been the best and we tend to butt heads a lot. He’s said a lot of questionable things in the past that i’ve written off because he’s my dad and i would never think he intended to be inappropriate or harmful. He’s been in my life since i was 8 years old. Of course I’m second guessing everything now that i’ve found this camera. It was positioned to point directly at my bedroom door from the far wall, so it has direct view of my entire room, which i change in. 

I tried desperately to rationalize it and think it was maybe a mistake, like he grabbed the wrong charger box. Or maybe he was just trying to look for intruders. But really there is no excuse for putting a camera in MY bedroom. the camera even had an SD card in it. I’m beyond devastated. My stepdad even suggested i invite my boyfriend over to while they’re gone so i have someone here, which is something he would never do considering he’s made it clear before he doesn’t want him over when no one is home because he doesn’t want us ‘fucking in his home’. My boyfriend and I are going to go through the SD card to see if there is anything on it.

I’m at a complete loss at how to even bring this up to my mom. I confided in my aunt and uncle since they live close by and they have been very supportive of me having a conversation with my mom about it. This whole situation is extremely upsetting, I at least have some family to support me as i navigate this but i don’t even know how to bring this up to my mom. This is obviously going to change everything. She had my five year old half brother with him. 

My mind is racing with the consequences this is going to have on our family. Has anyone that has been in a similar situation have advice? How can i do this without causing extreme damage to the family (although that may be impossible). Thank you in advance.

TLDR; i found a hidden camera that my stepdad put in my room, how do i bring this up to my mom?

UPDATE(1/?):

I don’t want to make a whole new thread since i want to make a new update when my parents get back monday, but i want to thank everyone for all the advice. i went to the police station tonight and filed a police report and turned in the spy camera with the SD card. The officer said this is a serious offense and i will likely get a call early next week from an investigator due to the severity of the situation. I’m planning on telling my mother about the police report after we have a conversation about this on monday, with my aunt and uncle present. 

As for people messaging me about my profile: thank you for reminding me to delete personal information. Please please do not dox or try to seek any sort of justice for me as this may affect my case. Respect my privacy during this time please as it may be crucial during this investigation.

This was the hardest thing i ever had to do, but whatever this shit was, it’s ending with me. I hope i can get justice for myself and any other victims who may have been violated by him since this will be heavily investigated and the officer said it will likely be looked into further (such as search warrants and looking for more SD cards). i’m hanging on by a thread but the support i have is what’s keeping me together. i’m staying with my boyfriend tonight to keep out of the house. Thanks again for all the love and supportive messages. I’ll update again soon.

UPDATE (2/?)

it’s the next morning and once my boyfriend wakes up we’re going back to my house today to look for any more secret cameras (either in the bathroom or my brothers rooms) so i can submit it for more evidence. i’m iffy about searching my parents room for more evidence as it’s likely he has a hidden camera in there to see me do it. still on the fence about having a police officer search the house, if i do i’ll be sure to update after i’m finished and in a safe place. my aunt has offered to come with me to help me search.

again, thank you everyone for the support. i’m trying as best i can to do this the right way and get as much done with the time i have left. i’m mentally and emotionally drained but i’ll be seeking resources once all of this is said and done. i’m reading everyone’s comments so i’m taking all the advice i can get.

UPDATE (3/?)

i probably won’t be able to update for a few days since today is the day that i talk to my mom, but i just wanted to share the plan i made and hopes for what happens today.

after talking with my aunt, uncle, boyfriend, and my cousin who is a civil lawyer, i’ve decided that i will speak to my mom in a separate location from my stepdad. most likely i’ll have her meet me somewhere outside of our home. i’ll have my aunt with me and this is where i’ll explain everything to her: the camera, past uncomfortable experiences i’ve had with my stepdad that i originally brushed off because he was my dad, video footage of him deliberately setting it up and angling it, and footage of me in my room. im praying she understands why i had to go to my aunt instead of her considering she was not in town and i was worried for her safety if i told her what happened. (she was stuck with him and my brothers about 4 hours away for the weekend) 

i’m hoping with my aunt there and her being away from my stepdad that it’ll prevent her from reacting out of anger and search for him and escalate the situation then and there, and i hope my aunt can provide some support for myself and her. i’m prepared for her to go through the same processes i went through such as reasoning and denial, but with the evidence there’s no possible way she can deny it. i’m preparing myself for the worst. i just hope that i can be strong for her and support her as this all hits her like it did me. 

i will not be returning home or facing him today. my boyfriend will be on standby to pick up my brothers if needed since my aunt has offered for them to stay with us so my mom can talk to my stepdad without them there. i’ll ask my mom to meet me and of course, not tell my stepdad about the circumstances. maybe she can tell him she’s going to the grocery store. i don’t want him getting any hints that she could be meeting
with me. 

i know i’ve said it a lot but i truly do appreciate the support system i have not only with my family but here too. this has been a nightmare but hearing everyone’s stories about this, proving it’s way too common, is what is helping me get through this and pushing me to do the right thing. not only am i a victim in this but my boyfriend as well and god knows who else. the confrontation won’t happen for about another 7 hours so i’m the meantime i’ll be reading over comments and preparing myself for what comes today. thank you guys.","Original Post:

Content: Having a preference isnt the same as a fetish. Someone with a fetish only dates a person because that person is asian. Not because they like the person, just because they fit the fetish.

Do other things do it for you too? Do you also like the person for reasons that arent their ethnicity?

I live with a partner with whom we are not a couple and we practice sexworking together and independently. Our lives are very much connected and interdepended. They pay for rent, amenities etc. I offer tech support, emotional support, taking photos, resolving issues they wouldn’t.. they invited me to have this type of domestic economy. One day they told me to act together on camera for a client. We have worked together before but it never felt as it should and we had discussed about it, even though we are both functional and well received as performers separately. There was never a conversation about me owing anything for the access to house spaces etc to do escorting, I was always welcome to do so. 

So, that day, they approach me for that double camera session and they knew my requested gift for that but suggested a lower price. I named my regular price 240 but said that I would do it for 200. I was already ready for action i didn’t want to overthink it. (I do this for the money ofc but I also really enjoy it) We did a gig for 600 in total. And right after it was over the client asked to go for more via DMs. We said 200 extra (the amount of the gift depends on the duration). So because the allowance was sent to my account and I was transferring to theirs I was about to send them 100 at that point and they asked me for 50 more. I was puzzled and asked what for and they attacked me on the grounds of them helping me financially many times and didn’t want me to react to their request this way because it was just 50 and they shouldn’t have to explain because of the nature/dynamics of our relationship. I was already thinking of leaving money after the gig for the house, which i also have done multiple times before and i was buying food after every session i had, I knew I was not someone who doesn’t like to take to advantage of other people’s work and I thought we had an agreement. Anyway, I told them that what they say is valid but I didn’t want to deal with that a minute after we finished our session and were waiting for the client to send more to start again as sex is a very sensitive time for me and my feelings especially when we do it together. They said that life is fast and like that and I cannot react this way because this is business. I sent 150. They client never sent more money so in the end I had 150 and they had 450 from that gig of 600 in total. And that didn’t feel good at all.

I have access to their dms, with their permission in case they want me to do sexting session for them, which has happened many times and I take that money. they just don’t want to lose clients if they are preoccupied. I accessed the dms because I could not stop thinking whether I was raped or not, wether they knew that that extra 200 were not gonna happen when they asked me to send the 150. They really didn’t. But I could not talk about this after the attack on my ethics. For the last months we have been feeling our relationship is toxic. They have accused me of taking financial advantage of them, of not being able to trust me but I also feel the same way (regardless of the incident). I know they didn’t think about the imbalance of our earnings that night but I am not sure if they used my vulnerability in sex to monitor me or figure me out which is definitely not something I have consented to. They know me very well, they see things in me I was not able to acknowledge. They know how to utilise sex in their favour and I have never seen them being genuinely happy when I achieve things in the field like good customers etc. Once a customer they knew booked me and in one conversation they mentioned it was their client to reinforce their narrative about an argument so I know they weren’t happy. One other time a very good customer of them also approached me and the day after i informed them about it they said he also texted them and we should a gig together. I was like i think we should do separate gigs with him and the customer never replied back to me when he was really enthusiastic before. I cannot know if they did something there but I have a bad feeling as they day after that their dms account was unlinked from my device.

Bottom line after context, i know this relationship is toxic, but if they engage with my sexuality in a non consensual way is this domestic sexual assault? I have explained clearly and many times I do sexwork to practice with my body, that I evolve through this process, that I have chosen it for a number of reasons including reclaiming my identity and sexual confidence. Was I sexually assaulted when they asked for that money if I know there is spite against me and i know they know my vulnerabilities specifically when we act together?

Content: This is a really tricky one. For me I’d say that it would fall under the banner of informed consent, in the sense that you agreed to have sex for a specific price and then you were pressured into giving away your money. Ie you didn’t consent to sex in that context for less money. It definitely falls under the banner of financial coercion though- them pressuring you for money isn’t cool at all. If they wanted more money that should have been a separate conversation outside of aex. The fact that they told you you’d get paid a specific amount, then pressured you out of the money suggests to me that this was a deliberate act, as they knew you would be easy to manipulate. I’m really sorry this happened to you.

Content: This is a tough situation...

Legally, I'm not sure this would qualify as sexual assault.  It might under the 'if you're under the influence you can't legally consent' doctrine but that's iffy.  From what you said, you never actually said 'no' or 'I don't want to'.  And you could make the argument that you were coerced but he can simply say he had no way of knowing that or about your drug interaction, you seemed into it.  

Ethically though, I think it qualifies as assault (or at least as abuse).  If you were that far gone it's unlikely that you were very coherent or talkative, and if he was driving drunk that's also a bad thing.  

I think the most important thing though (and I think this is what you're sort of asking) is I don't think you are responsible for what happened.  If there is a drug interaction that caused you to get far more drunk than usual, to the point that you don't even remember what happened, that's not your fault.  

I would however suggest maybe don't hang out with those friends much again.  Leaving without you is not the kind of thing a good friend does.  I can say for me personally if I see a friend (of either gender) getting wasted when we're out, I'm going to make damn sure they either get home safely or specifically want me to leave without them.

title, basically. here’s the context: 

i am a minor, 14 at the time this happened, & i went on a camping trip with my friend & his family. His mom’s best friend was also there. I feel like i should mention that I’m female.

title, basically. here’s the context: 

i am a minor, 14 at the time this happened, & i went on a camping trip with my friend & his family. His mom’s best friend was also there. I feel like i should mention that I’m female.

When i was young, maybe 7 or 8 i remember that my masturbation started and my intrusive thoughts. They were about rape and fear of being a pedophile and got really bad, i had so much fear of being a pedophile at that age and even felt scared and guilt about my parents finding out about me when something abt pedophilia was on tv and they watched it and my intrusive thoughts about raping my usually male friends tormented me, fast forward some years, i was about 15 and a man sexually assaulted me, he touched me and stuff, and in that exact moment i remember not just feeling terrified but like it was okay, as if it was okay this happened and i was ""comfortable"" with it, like i knew what to do, its only now i realize what this feeling was. I also remember for almost as long as i know that i was really deeply ashamed of my body and never wanted to take my shirt off or show my legs, i also became more and more alone from age 10 and i remember 1 time when i was bed wetting at an older age, like 8 or 9 or so and thinking ""why does this happen?""  because i knew i was too old for that. I have always felt really weird about being myself and never knew why.

Am i making this all up? Or mixing it with other stuff like my father beating my moms head into the wall or screaming at me? Do my now traumas make me believe there was something bc i supress them? 

I also have moments in which i deeply resonate with hearing about childhood sexual trauma, but i dont know if i really do so or if its just my now trauma making me understand it.

Content: From what you described about being scared of being a pedophile, it sounds a lot like OCD to me. But then you also describe bed wetting and resonating with CSA stories. No one on Reddit can tell you for certain if you were SAd as a child, that’s something only your memory can do, or a trauma therapist. If you’re worried I’d recommend finding a professional to talk to, and maybe look into OCD as well, to see if that resonates. Wish you all the best.

Author: hardmenchocker66
Content: Hey, yes i also think OCD was definetely the case for me, i used to always be forced to tap 5 times with my fingers, or move my lips 5 or 7 times. I just dont know whats wrong, i dont even know if it happened because 1 time somebody told me about them getting raped and it felt foreign to me hearing about it, another time it felt like i was getting a flash of very deep feelings, but as everything it changes everyday and i have a really bad sense of time. I will try to find a professional to find out more, i want to, its just difficult to tell that to my mother because i dont know how to explain it to her. Thank you for your response! I wish you the best too:)

We were invited to this party and I had wayyy too much to drink on an empty stomach. He drank too but he was good enough to drive me home. I don't remember much of the night, only bits and pieces but I know that I had lost my virginity. I know that it happened I just don't remember it.

It hurts me that he brushed it off and made me feel like I was being dramatic.
I wouldn't call it rape because knowing me when I get drunk I make stupid impulsive decisions, I probably asked him for it. I just hate that he agreed fully knowing I would never agree to it sober.

5 months ago, I (19F) and my ex boyfriend (20M) had only officially been together for about two weeks and had been regularly having sex. I came over to his place and we hung out for a few hours until he got a message from some friends asking if he wanted to get drunk and hang out.

Title: Was this sexual assault?
Body: I came to Reddit to ask for any outsiders' opinions on whether this was sexual assault or not.

5 months ago, I (19F) and my ex boyfriend (20M) had only officially been together for about two weeks and had been regularly having sex. I came over to his place and we hung out for a few hours until he got a message from some friends asking if he wanted to get drunk and hang out. I was tired, so I asked if I could stay and take a nap while he was at his neighbor's place drinking with friends. He said yes and that if I needed him, to come get him next door.

I have so many thoughts and feelings, so thanks for understanding any poor grammar or anything in this rant.

&#x200B;

Yesterday I went to an asian massage parlor that I've been to many times before. Usually, I do a cheap fully clothed reflexology massage, but yesterday I decided to treat myself to a full body 90 min massage.   I've gotten massages many times before and am very comfortable with getting my body touched and am ok with getting my butt massaged.

&#x200B;

When I first arrived, they took me to a room where I quickly got undressed, everything except my underwear under the sheets.  I was wearing glasses that day, so I took those off too, so my vision was very impaired, which is fine because my eyes are closed the whole time. The man working started working on my neck shoulders, backs, buttocks and legs. He started to massage my butt over the sheets and I was fine with it. I've gotten massages before and they've massaged my butt in the past, so that didn't seem out of the ordinary. Everything seemed fine, except for when he was massaging my butt, my underwear was rubbing against my skin and it made me feel itchy. (This is where I fucked up). I told him that was happening and asked if I could remove my underwear. I kept the sheet over me the whole time and then we were back to normal. He continued the massage as normal and at the time, it felt mostly normal. Looking back, there are a few things that I thought were weird , but  I didn't feel crazy uncomfortable at the time.

&#x200B;

I then rotated to massage the front side. He massaged my face and then the shoulders again. He then asked me if I wanted oil or lotion. I was like whatever you've been doing this whole time?  He covers my face with a towel and proceeds to start massaging my shoulders and then works his way down to my arms.  He massaging my legs and starts inching closer to my pubic area. This is when things start getting weird, I'm wondering if he's getting kind of close and at points, I'm honestly even slightly aroused, but I'm thinking, he's a professional, there's no way that this is happening and thought it was all in my head.  He kind of stops that area and then moves back to chest and removes the towel from my breasts to that I'm fully exposed. I'm alarmed, but just so shocked that this is happening to do anything. He moves back to my legs and sticks his fingers in my vagina. What the fuck is this really happening? Why am I not stopping him? What is going on? After a few seconds, I can't believe I took me this long, I motioned his arm away and use the towels to cover my chest.   He continues to massage my legs and then finally I just got the courage to tell him I need to stop and grab the towel, wrap it around my body, and ask him to leave. He just keeps pointing at something and saying something over and over and I'm not understanding, i just want to go. He then finally grabs a wet towel and says, towel for the oil. He tries to wrap it over and I'm just like no, I can do this myself. He quickly hands me a few more towels and leaves as I quickly dress and try get the fuck out of there.

&#x200B;

As I leave, I told the front desk guy that I'm not paying for anything and that was unacceptable. I couldn't get the courage to tell him what happened and just left.  Moments later, I get to the car and I call him back and told him that the masseuse touched me inappropriately and that they need to do something about it. He apologized, but I was too pissed to see if that was even sincere.  I managed to call back later and asked for the masseuse's name and license number, they gave it to me, and then quickly hung up.

&#x200B;

Since then, Ive been racking my brain about this whole situation. I feel so much shame and guilt. I feel like I let myself be in this situation. I should have stopped him when things were getting weird, but I didn't. Was I asking for this because I was slightly aroused? Not by him personally, but like someone is touching your leg? I have a boyfriend, how is this going to affect him? How is he going to be hurt to know this happened? I don't know. I know what everyone is going to say, but I can't help but just feel like it's my fault. I thought that if I was in a situation like this, I would know how to speak up. Why didn't I feel outraged as this was happening? I thought that I would know and feel extremely violated, but was I just in extreme shock?  I took off my underwear during the massage, that wasn't fucking smart. What the fuck was I thinking?? I don't know what to do. I know everyone's going to say to file a report or whatever, but what happens after that?  Halp.","Original Post:

Content: That's not rape or coercing. Don't listen to the idiots here. They are eager to call anything they can as rape.



In that scenario you didn't withdraw consent, you only expressed dissatisfaction with the experience.




You need to actually say no.



That being said your bf seems like an ass and I wouldn't put up with that.

Comment (depth 1):
Author: _lost_in_thoughts_
Content: Saying ""I'm not in the mood anymore"" is 100% a withdrawal of consent. 

You do not have to say ""no"" to withdrawal or not give consent. There are many ways to say you do not consent, such as: 

I'm not in the mood. 

I don't really want to.

I don't feel good. 

I'm not really sure. 

I don't know. 

And the list goes on. OP also said she was crying. That in itself means they want you to stop. 

Saying you have to say ""no"" to revoke or not give consent is used to justify rape/sexual assault because the victim ""didn't say no.""

Comment (depth 2):
Author: Bartimaeus222
Content: No it's not. It depends on the nature of your relationship. People aren't in the mood for a lot of things but still volountarily do it.


I missed the part with crying.


The guy is a asshole, it's not rape though.


No, they consented and didn't withdraw. It's not the same thing as knocking someone out and saying it's okay because they aren't saying no.

Comment (depth 3):
Author: _lost_in_thoughts_
Content: No it's not the same as knocking someone out, but ""they didn't say no"" *is* an excuse people use to justify sexual assault. Even if the person was awake during the attack. 

Yes, people do things they don't want to do, but when it comes to sex, that should not be the case. It does not depend on the ""nature of your relationship,"" as marital rape is a thing and is fairly common. 

I will not argue about this. Please educate yourself on what consent is.

Comment (depth 4):
Author: Bartimaeus222
Content: Your desires on should are not relevant.


This is the standard for consent now. You don't get to change the rules and retroactively call people rapists because they aren't mind readers.



If I'm having sex and my girl wants to sit on my face she can. If I want that to stop I have to say so, I don't just let it happen and call it rape.


You people are dumb as shit.

Comment (depth 5):
Author: _lost_in_thoughts_
Content: If a girl is sitting on your face, and you say, ""I'd like you to get off my face,"" or ""could you get off my face"", or simply ""get off my face,"" that means you do not want her to be on your face and she, assuming she's a decent human being, will understand that you no longer consent to her being on your face and get off. Because what you said, equates to saying no. 

The ""standard of consent"" is *enthusiastic* consent. She was not enthusiastic. She said she wasn't in the mood. She straight up said she didn't want to have sex (which literally means no). She even cried. And he continued. That was coercion. 

Have a nice night, and once again, please educate yourself on what consent is.

Comment (depth 6):
Author: Bartimaeus222
Content: You are making different statements. Get off my face is a command, I'm not enjoying this is not.


That's not a standard. I don't have to ecstatic if my girl wants to hook up. I decide what is okay for myself. You don't get to tell me I was raped because of your new subjective standard.


You need to learn what words mean. Consent is explicit. Your standard is subjective to your opinion.

I’m now 16(f) but when I was around 12 or 13 I went to a sleepover, there were 6 girls there(including me). The girl whose house it was was extremely open as lesbian and of course we were all completely fine with that because she’s our friend. We were in her bedroom which was literally just a mattress on the floor and a tv. A few hours before, she’d had an argument with the rest of the girls as they’d gone to the shop late at night when she told them not to (I was the only one who stayed at her house with her when the rest went to the shop) so she let me lay on the mattress with her, while the other girls were on the floor. We were both facing right while laying down, until she turns around so that she’s facing me, our faces are really close together and she seems like she’s trying to get comfortable, it’s rlly hard to explain. I was fully awake and so was she, she then slid her hand up my pajama top and under my bra and layed her hand on my chest.(Not trying to be tmi but I went through puberty pretty early, probably when i was around 8 so my chest was more developed than most girls there, which made this even more uncomfortable for me) At this point I really didn’t know what to do as I, 1)never showed any interest in her in that way, and 2)everyone was surrounding us yet nobody had seen it happen so they couldn’t get her off me. Even though I was a lot bigger than her I just completely froze and didn’t know what to do until I got the courage to take her hand out of my top, she kind of groaned in a way that sounded annoyed that i was doing that but I still managed to get her hand out. I then turned to face the other way and went to sleep. It wasn’t until the next morning when I was leaving that I realised what she had done might be counted as sexual assault. I really don’t know if it was though because I never even tried to tell her no, I just froze, although she fully knew what sexual assault was as she said her ex girlfriend had done it to her, so this is where i get conflicted as I can’t blame our young age because she was fully aware, but I never actually said no, plus I don’t even know if it’s possible for me as a girl to be sexually assaulted by another girl who’s actually a few months younger than me.
I just needed to get this off my chest to people who may be able to help me understand what happened as it’s been stuck on my mind for years and years and always makes me nauseous at the thought of it.

Also, just to clarify, she has never ever mentioned it since so i’ve come to believe that it was so insignificant to her that she can’t even remember it happening. ","Original Post:

We were both facing right while laying down, until she turns around so that she’s facing me, our faces are really close together and she seems like she’s trying to get comfortable, it’s rlly hard to explain. I was fully awake and so was she, she then slid her hand up my pajama top and under my bra and layed her hand on my chest.(Not trying to be tmi but I went through puberty pretty early, probably when i was around 8 so my chest was more developed than most girls there, which made this even more uncomfortable for me) At this point I really didn’t know what to do as I, 1)never showed any interest in her in that way, and 2)everyone was surrounding us yet nobody had seen it happen so they couldn’t get her off me. Even though I was a lot bigger than her I just completely froze and didn’t know what to do until I got the courage to take her hand out of my top, she kind of groaned in a way that sounded annoyed that i was doing that but I still managed to get her hand out. I then turned to face the other way and went to sleep. It wasn’t until the next morning when I was leaving that I realised what she had done might be counted as sexual assault. I really don’t know if it was though because I never even tried to tell her no, I just froze, although she fully knew what sexual assault was as she said her ex girlfriend had done it to her, so this is where i get conflicted as I can’t blame our young age because she was fully aware, but I never actually said no, plus I don’t even know if it’s possible for me as a girl to be sexually assaulted by another girl who’s actually a few months younger than me.
I just needed to get this off my chest to people who may be able to help me understand what happened as it’s been stuck on my mind for years and years and always makes me nauseous at the thought of it.

Also, just to clarify, she has never ever mentioned it since so i’ve come to believe that it was so insignificant to her that she can’t even remember it happening.

Content: It sounds like your cleavage,it would be right between your breasts. This is a sexual area without permission, so that would fall under sexual assault. If she touched the breasts with her hand between that clearly is sexual assault. (both are but a sexual body parts is an easier call than a part adjacent, but under a bra is pretty personal.

So, yes. It sounds like she made a move without consent and was upset you rejected her. She should know better.","Information support, Esteem support",True,Decent_Discussion847,0,Starfury7-Jaargen,False,,"Information support, Emotional support",title_only,YES,YES,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO

Hi there,

I’ve been dating my boyfriend for nearly 7 months. I’ve always been aware of his manipulative behaviours and have always pulled him up on them. Even when he has changed them, I’ve always been worried he’d adapt in another way. 

Last night I went to a party with him with my friends. We got drunk, him more so. I made it specifically clear at the start (when sober) to not do anything or try anything. This is a huge boundary for me since I have been in a horrible situation with my past boyfriend, and it obviously made me very hyperaware and cautious. My current boyfriend knew of what happened as well, and seemed very caring to catering to my trauma.

Throughout the night, he kept fondling me and groping me- even when I yelled no and pushed him off. He also, kept trying to make out with me, even when I told him no. He would hold my head and not allow me to pull back, even though I  managed to every time. He kept on sexually touching me for HOURS and it got to a point where I plead with him to stop. He would repetitively shove his hands down my pants. At the end, I once again pushed him off when he tried to force himself on me, and he ran away crying. My friends told me he was hysterical, so I went up to him. He basically outlined that I was neglecting his needs and he didn’t feel loved since I didn’t want to give him physical affection. He made it out to me being wrong and cruel for not giving him what he wanted. I apologised, feeling awfully bad, and he tried INSTANTLY again after. 

He knows that I have deep-rooted trauma about this specific area, which makes me even more upset. I’m not sure If I am overreacting or that my emotions are actually reasonable. I feel so used, and hurt. I’m not sure what to do. When asked about it- when he approached my friend the day after, he said he did it because he was in a ‘bad mind set’ and ‘anxious’, and he really needed physical affection (since he claims that is his love language). However, I’m not entirely sure how forcing yourself on someone, for HOURS, and being yelled to stop- is love language?

I guess I really had to get this off my chest. One part of me is belittling myself for being upset- and subliminally saying its not a big deal. Meanwhile, another part is extremely hurt and upset with his actions. I’d really like to hear an outside perspective of this.","Original Post:

I just wanted some closure as to whether or not I experienced sexual assault, or just grew up in an ignorant household. I am 24, unemployed, and still live at home.

I've had some odd experiences growing up (at least I question them now), and I wanted to make sure my feelings were legitimate. Here's some things I grew up with:

-My dad would let me bathe with him when I was about 3.

-When I was a bit older, I saw my father peeing in the bathroom. I didn't really understand what a penis was, so I asked if I could touch it. He agreed, and I did. Then I giggled and ran away shortly after.

-My father also likes to tap my ass/lower waist when he wants to acknowledge me. I've brought up to him that I didn't like it in front of my mom, and he told me, ""Well, it develops character."" He still touches my butt every once in a while. Sometimes if I see he's behind me coming up the stairs, I walk up faster so he won't do it.


I told my therapist all this when I was 18. I didn't tell her any earlier in fears that I would be forced into foster care--leaving behind everything I knew. She told me if I were younger, she would have to report it and I would, in fact, be placed in foster care because my mom wouldn't be able to take care of me. My father probably would have been a registered sex offender and lost his pension. If I said anything when I was under 18, it would have tarnished our family's reputation and our income.

My therapist also talks to my mom, and I gave her permission to talk to her about it since I was too afraid to say something myself. This eventually became a weird forced conversation to her when we went for a walk at a local park. It made me feel uncomfortable because I wasn't fully ready to talk to her about it. I don't think I ever will. My mom heard my stories, but didn't do anything about it. It makes me feel like what I've experienced wasn't really a big deal.

I always thought my dad was a creepy guy, but I'm afraid that it may be a little bit more than creepy. Am I crazy, or are the situations really damaging?","Original Post:

It has been perhaps a month since it happened but I can’t stop thinking about it - my male friend was standing in front of me, a bit to the side, and somehow (I wasn’t looking in his direction so I couldn’t exactly see) tripped and his hand bashed my breast. After this, he muttered a ”Hm. Whoops.” And faced The other direction while we waited for our bus. He didn’t look shocked but he also didn’t look entertained. Just a blank-ish expression with his mouth open a bit - not much emotion going on.

He had never done anything like this before. And I don’t understand how he could’ve tripped. He was standing perfectly fine on a flat concrete surface that had nothing he could trip over on it but somehow went close enough to me and landed on my chest and seemingly grabbed my  breast?? We always keep some distance so we aren’t touching as I usually like having a lot of personal space. He had also been facing forwards so I don’t understand how the process of his body twisting nearly 180 to face me happened. This was a complete shock. My breast was sore for about half an hour afterwards. No one has ever touched me in that location before.   


This was essentially one of the last interactions we have had (all that have followed are him looking at me while we were in line for coffee/drinks then acting like he didn’t see me and his friends walking past with him and they said hello). He is also in a relationship now - I don’t want to cause any trouble.   


He hasn’t really given a proper apology but I haven’t asked for one or even addressed it. But I dont see him much anymore so I haven’t had the chance and now it feels too late. I was just really shocked and confused. Does this count as SA or anything? I hope not - I don’t think I’m part of the 97%  but I’m not really sure what counts.

Content: Going off the information given this seems like a complete accident and should be forgotten about, probably even laughed about. 

Feeling a breast and bashing one so hard you're sore for an hour are very different things. Random losses of balance happen. Seems like he's moved on and has no history of being weird. I do think he should issue a better apology but honestly sounds like he's so embarrassed he's just trying to hope it goes away.

Content: If you lose consciousness at any point, say no, try to stop him, try to move away from him, etc., it is sexual assault. Anything that indicates you can’t continue to consent or have stopped consenting is sexual assault. He also fed you more alcohol when you didn’t want more, he was intentionally trying to get you so drunk you wouldn’t be able to consent. He raped you. I am so, so sorry. What you’re describing is deeply horrific and incredibly disturbing. He had no reason to do this so it means he wanted to rape you. Please break up with him at the very least and if you feel strong enough go to the police. Your boyfriend is dangerous. Do not see him again and cut all contact. I promise you, he is a horrible person.","Information support, Emotional support, Esteem support",True,AdSignal589,0,peachsandwich,False,,"Information support, Emotional support",title_only,YES,YES,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO

I couldn’t go on the trip since i had work, so i was staying home to house sit and feed our animals. My stepdad recently put up new cameras outside so I didn’t see anything wrong with him positioning one outside my window. Come to find out the very next day, I had my boyfriend stay over and he found that the surveillance camera that was ran from outside my window and into my room was being powered by one of those spy camera power blocks. 

For context, my relationship with my stepdad hasn’t always been the best and we tend to butt heads a lot. He’s said a lot of questionable things in the past that i’ve written off because he’s my dad and i would never think he intended to be inappropriate or harmful. He’s been in my life since i was 8 years old. Of course I’m second guessing everything now that i’ve found this camera. It was positioned to point directly at my bedroom door from the far wall, so it has direct view of my entire room, which i change in. 

I tried desperately to rationalize it and think it was maybe a mistake, like he grabbed the wrong charger box. Or maybe he was just trying to look for intruders. But really there is no excuse for putting a camera in MY bedroom. the camera even had an SD card in it. I’m beyond devastated. My stepdad even suggested i invite my boyfriend over to while they’re gone so i have someone here, which is something he would never do considering he’s made it clear before he doesn’t want him over when no one is home because he doesn’t want us ‘fucking in his home’. My boyfriend and I are going to go through the SD card to see if there is anything on it.

I’m at a complete loss at how to even bring this up to my mom. I confided in my aunt and uncle since they live close by and they have been very supportive of me having a conversation with my mom about it. This whole situation is extremely upsetting, I at least have some family to support me as i navigate this but i don’t even know how to bring this up to my mom. This is obviously going to change everything. She had my five year old half brother with him. 

My mind is racing with the consequences this is going to have on our family. Has anyone that has been in a similar situation have advice? How can i do this without causing extreme damage to the family (although that may be impossible). Thank you in advance.

TLDR; i found a hidden camera that my stepdad put in my room, how do i bring this up to my mom?

UPDATE(1/?):

I don’t want to make a whole new thread since i want to make a new update when my parents get back monday, but i want to thank everyone for all the advice. i went to the police station tonight and filed a police report and turned in the spy camera with the SD card. The officer said this is a serious offense and i will likely get a call early next week from an investigator due to the severity of the situation. I’m planning on telling my mother about the police report after we have a conversation about this on monday, with my aunt and uncle present. 

As for people messaging me about my profile: thank you for reminding me to delete personal information. Please please do not dox or try to seek any sort of justice for me as this may affect my case. Respect my privacy during this time please as it may be crucial during this investigation.

This was the hardest thing i ever had to do, but whatever this shit was, it’s ending with me. I hope i can get justice for myself and any other victims who may have been violated by him since this will be heavily investigated and the officer said it will likely be looked into further (such as search warrants and looking for more SD cards). i’m hanging on by a thread but the support i have is what’s keeping me together. i’m staying with my boyfriend tonight to keep out of the house. Thanks again for all the love and supportive messages. I’ll update again soon.

UPDATE (2/?)

it’s the next morning and once my boyfriend wakes up we’re going back to my house today to look for any more secret cameras (either in the bathroom or my brothers rooms) so i can submit it for more evidence. i’m iffy about searching my parents room for more evidence as it’s likely he has a hidden camera in there to see me do it. still on the fence about having a police officer search the house, if i do i’ll be sure to update after i’m finished and in a safe place. my aunt has offered to come with me to help me search.

again, thank you everyone for the support. i’m trying as best i can to do this the right way and get as much done with the time i have left. i’m mentally and emotionally drained but i’ll be seeking resources once all of this is said and done. i’m reading everyone’s comments so i’m taking all the advice i can get.

UPDATE (3/?)

i probably won’t be able to update for a few days since today is the day that i talk to my mom, but i just wanted to share the plan i made and hopes for what happens today.

after talking with my aunt, uncle, boyfriend, and my cousin who is a civil lawyer, i’ve decided that i will speak to my mom in a separate location from my stepdad. most likely i’ll have her meet me somewhere outside of our home. i’ll have my aunt with me and this is where i’ll explain everything to her: the camera, past uncomfortable experiences i’ve had with my stepdad that i originally brushed off because he was my dad, video footage of him deliberately setting it up and angling it, and footage of me in my room. im praying she understands why i had to go to my aunt instead of her considering she was not in town and i was worried for her safety if i told her what happened. (she was stuck with him and my brothers about 4 hours away for the weekend) 

i’m hoping with my aunt there and her being away from my stepdad that it’ll prevent her from reacting out of anger and search for him and escalate the situation then and there, and i hope my aunt can provide some support for myself and her. i’m prepared for her to go through the same processes i went through such as reasoning and denial, but with the evidence there’s no possible way she can deny it. i’m preparing myself for the worst. i just hope that i can be strong for her and support her as this all hits her like it did me. 

i will not be returning home or facing him today. my boyfriend will be on standby to pick up my brothers if needed since my aunt has offered for them to stay with us so my mom can talk to my stepdad without them there. i’ll ask my mom to meet me and of course, not tell my stepdad about the circumstances. maybe she can tell him she’s going to the grocery store. i don’t want him getting any hints that she could be meeting
with me. 

i know i’ve said it a lot but i truly do appreciate the support system i have not only with my family but here too. this has been a nightmare but hearing everyone’s stories about this, proving it’s way too common, is what is helping me get through this and pushing me to do the right thing. not only am i a victim in this but my boyfriend as well and god knows who else. the confrontation won’t happen for about another 7 hours so i’m the meantime i’ll be reading over comments and preparing myself for what comes today. thank you guys.","Original Post:

Content: Definitely coercive behaviour, maybe she isn't aware and just sees it as rejection and convincing you. I wouldn't actually go so far as to say rape but clearly on the wrong side of the line. There must be a deeper problem within her and that is for therapists to work out.

Hi everyone, I’ve posted this in a few threads because I desperately need advice I need to know if I’m crazy for feeling like this 

I (f) have a friend (f) I’ve known for a while, and recently she told me she’s in love with me.
I don’t feel the same way at all, and ever since the confession things have started clicking into place in a way that’s making me feel sick.

Now that I’m looking back, a lot of her behaviour wasn’t “playful” or “quirky” & it feels sexual and predatory, and I genuinely didn’t consent to ANY of it.

Now that I replay everything with that context, I feel extremely uncomfortable, and honestly… violated.

Here are some of the behaviours that are now making my stomach turn:

	•	She will just start “play fighting” with me touching my breasts during. I always hated it and froze up, but she acted like it was joking around. I never consented to anything sexual.

	•	She has shown me explicit nudes and videos of herself on FaceTime via screen-share. I felt cornered because I knew if I didn’t react politely she’d be upset.& I just told myself that she just showed me that because she felt like she could trust me? But I would feel sick every time she’d show me. 

	•	One time when I using alcohol to cope and I was constantly drunk and vulnerable, I mentioned I had no money left for more alcohol. She offered to send me money if I showed her my vagina. At the time I thought she was joking, but I was drunk and I wanted to stay drunk. She sent the money. Now it feels… awful.
	•	She has asked me multiple times if she can perform oral sex on me, saying she wants to “make me feel good.” Every time I say no, she starts shaking, crying, or having a panic response saying she feels ugly and unworthy.

	•	She copies me constantly. My scent, my clothes, certain things that I say, almost like she’s trying to become me.

	•	She gets jealous and competitive any time a man shows interest in me, or even when I’m talking about someone else.

	•	She’s overly touchy, even though she knows I’m autistic with hypersensitivity to touch and I always tell her I don’t like being touched. 

	•	She once showed me an explicit porn video (two women scissoring) on FaceTime despite knowing I hate porn. She forcibly shared her screen and I couldn’t stop it. That’s the only time she ever apologised because I lost it with her I was so angry that time. 

	•	She keeps bringing up her feelings, even after telling me she wouldn’t. It’s like she wants me to hold her emotional burden.

	•	She has said things like “if my life doesn’t improve next year, I’ll end it,” which makes me feel trapped and responsible for her stability.

What’s really messing with my head is that I told myself it was harmless or that she didn’t mean it that way, but the confession made me realise that NONE of this came from a platonic place.

I feel violated and uncomfortable in my own body now. I don’t want her touching me, talking sexually near me, sending me sexual content, or “play fighting” with me ever again. I also don’t feel safe rejecting her because she has panic attacks and emotional breakdowns anytime she’s crossed my boundaries and I tell her that.

I’m scared to end the friendship because I don’t want to be alone, but I’m realising this friendship isn’t safe or healthy for me.

Is this sexual assault? Has anyone been through something similar? How do I end this without her spiralling? I just need to hear from other survivors because I feel incredibly confused and gross right now.","Original Post:

I'll try and make this short. Went out with friends, got very drunk, lost friends, ended up going to a bar.

1rxbyq,[deleted]@0,relationships,cdrvqyt,t1_cdrvddu,1,throwawayerrdayy,"Wow, thank you for the response.

About the my dad thing. He has gone from almost despising her existence to welcoming her, and my mum really likes her too. I feel like I'm in too deep and its scary to get out. Not only because of the judgement by my parents but because I do love her.

Ill try and put a decent tl;dr at the end.

I will begin by saying that the reason that the title says 'girlfriend' is because we aren't actually together. We are 'seeing each other' basically because I have commitment issues. We have been in this situation since around July. Henceforth in this post I will refer to her as Sandra.

My comittment issues mainly stem from my previous reasonably long term relationship between age 15 and 17. The whole ordeal of the messy horrible breakup kind of stayed with me since then and I haven't been able to commit to anyone since. I did date someone for a little while but then broke it off.

Me and Sandra met online in June but didn't actually meet in person until September. From July we were 'exclusively seeing each other' which were my terms because I didn't want to commit to someone over the internet. She was pretty intent on being together after about a week which probably should have been a big warning sign for me. She knew about my commitment issues and id told her it could be a long time until we actually got together.

She came and stayed for the weekend and she got quite upset saying that I will never want to be with her properly and I felt really bad. Every time I want to make it official I just can't do it. We are practically together yet there is something about the title that scares me. She is a really great girl and I love her to bits but there of course are things about her that I'm not so keen on.

I spoke to my dad recently about her and said that I'm not sure if I want to be in a relationship right now and I don't know if I want to be in one going into university. He basically told me not to mess her around so I feel pressured by him to get with her even if its not what I want. Sandra knows that I'm not sure if I want a relationship going into uni and get upset yet quickly carried on believing we would last forever.

I've never been long distance so I wanted to give it a try and its been ok. I trust her a lot and I've had freedom when she's not around. My issue is that of we stayed together we wouldn't see each other regularly until at least 2018. I don't think I can do that. On top of this, becoming official feels too much for me but ending it cmpletely feels too extreme too. I know I can't keep myself or her in this limbo forever.

I guess what I'm asking is; should I end it on good terms? Should I make it official and see how it goes?

I know these are questions that no one can really answer except me but any guidance would be greatly appreciated. Even if I don't get any advice on here it feels good to finally get my thoughts on paper. This whole thing has been wearing me down mentally for a while. Thanks for the help.

Tl;dr have been 'seeing' Sandra for many months. Crunch time on whether to take the next step or not. I feel under pressure from family to take it further. I love her a lot yet can't bring myself to do it no matter how hard I try. Am I a victim of right person wrong time? What do you think I should do?","Original Post:

Content: You're 19, and the fact that you know you're not ready to settle down is not a bad thing. Lots of people that age think they are, then 15 or so years later (if even that) they're in divorce court. 

> I spoke to my dad recently about her and said that I'm not sure if I want to be in a relationship right now and I don't know if I want to be in one going into university. He basically told me not to mess her around so I feel pressured by him to get with her even if its not what I want.

Reading that it sounds like your dad wants you to either commit or let her go. That's really the right thing to do here. And it sounds like you've already come to the decision that you aren't ready to commit. 

So, rather than leave the girl you love in this limbo land of ""will he or won't he"", maybe you should go ahead and let her go. You're both young, and perhaps later on things will come around and you'll both be ready to settle down. But don't feel like you have to marry this girl tomorrow. I think that would be the biggest mistake.

This happened at a party and me and a old friend 20F planned to attend a party at my house. A little backstory we have not talked in 6 months due to a fight we had prior but I decided talk again and fix things that night because of her [b](https://behavior.My)ehavior. My friend tends to be controlling in a way where she wont stop texting and trying to talk until you actually did. I didn't really think it was too bad until I thought about it over time but, to sum it up she would text me constantly and show up to my house unannounced in order to try to get me to forgive her. So when I did and we finished talking I went to her apartment so that she could get ready. I asked her if she wanted to sleep over since it would be extremely late and she was home alone that night, and she agreed. We both made it very clear that we didn't want to have sex with each other that night, me especially since we have been fighting the months prior. I don't remember too much and I don't know if you call it getting blacked out drunk since if I'm correct blackout means you don't remember anything at all and I think I remember some flashes.

 But when we woke up in the morning she told me that we kissed and touched last night but didn't mention sex at all. She seemed really happy since she told me that I ""really wanted it last night."" I asked her if she was ok since I didn't remember too much and she said she was. She told me she was happy since it meant I wasn't mad at her anymore. We spent the entire day together and she kept joking about what happened and being very specific about some things which made me uncomfortable but I just let it slide. But as evening approached I asked to leave and before I did I told her ""I didn't know what happened but if I hurt you at all. I'm sorry."" I do typically apologize a lot for some reason even though things aren't my fault I don't know why. But as soon as I texted her that, she immediately begins to blame me for what happened and told me that it was my fault. I got information from a friend of hers saying that everything that took place that night took and estimated 4 hours and that I was passing in and out while it was happening. I do remember flashes of her smiling and I remember she was on top of me at one point. I'm not a hundred percent sure if this is from what happened or just a hallucination these images are just the most vivid out of all things I try to reimagine that night. I felt pretty bad after hearing all this and felt worse when I found out she was sober when it was going on. Its a little complicated right now since we are in similar friend groups which is another reason I chose to talk to her. But its split down the middle.

So what I'm confused about is if this is sexual assault or not since her friends are saying that being drunk isn't an excuse while mine are saying drunk people cant consent, especially in a situation like this.

Content: First of all, no, it isn't assault. He obviously didn't mean to hurt you. 
I once had a friend that forced me to be physical with him so I understand how it makes you feel when people ignore a 'no' in such a situation and my current boyfriend does that a lot, too. So does that make it assault? No. In most cases, my bf thinks I'm not serious about the 'no' I gave him so he still tries. I think it might be the same with your bf since he stopped as soon as you signaled him that you rly didn't want him to do that.
Now for the advice: Talk about it. Make sure you tell him that with you, no *always* means no and that it will never be a joke or something. It's literally all you can do. If it happens more often and he doesn't respect your 'no' it'd be the best for you to take a break or break up.

Content: He has been upset because of this incident is very guilty now, he doesn't talk to me now ..Like before because he thinks he is not worthy of me and I tried talking to him, he clearly understands that no means a no,but now he keeps asking me ""what if it happens again?"" He is not able to forget what happened, he is not able to forgive himself.all of this makes it hard for me to handle the issue given that I'm also an amateur when it comes to relationship.

This happened back in early March/end of February and I didn’t really think about it until now. We were teens at the time.

So I had this friend and we’ll call him Ty. So Ty had invited me over because his parents weren’t home and I came over just to hang out cause we were decent friends. 

He had picked me up and then held me like I was a child and forced me to cuddle with him. He also later pinned me down on the ground trying to kiss me (the whole night he kept trying to kiss me) and I kept struggling to get out of his grip but he knew I wasn’t strong enough to push him off.

The only reason he got off was because his parents came back and he ended up pushing me out the side door and I walked home. 

There’s also this second guy who we’ll call Carlos. We were at a friends birthday party and he purposely tried picking me up for the sole purpose of grabbing my ass. Putting his hands there saying that he was “just trying to hold me up” and then later said that it was okay if I punched him for what he did.

I’m much better now, but I still get anxiety around men. 

I’ll keep the details limited, but the long story of it all is that a classmate of mine kept me in his car, wouldn’t take me home, put his hands all over me, tried to get me to lay down with him over and over again. Then, when, (after an hour), he finally decided I got to go home, he pinned me against his car, fondled and groped me all over the place, and made out with my neck. All while I was trying to push him off. I never directly used the word no, (I have anxiety), but I made it clear that I didn’t want it, that I was tired and he needed to take me home, and then, when he had me pinned against the car, I tried to push him off the entire time. My school, (a private college), thought it serious enough to go through the title-IX process, but my brain tells me it wasn’t actually sexual assault.

Title: Does this count as sexual assault?
Body: I (f24), have been struggling with this ever since it happened and I went through the title IX process at my college. I’m much better now, but I still get anxiety around men. 

I’ll keep the details limited, but the long story of it all is that a classmate of mine kept me in his car, wouldn’t take me home, put his hands all over me, tried to get me to lay down with him over and over again. Then, when, (after an hour), he finally decided I got to go home, he pinned me against his car, fondled and groped me all over the place, and made out with my neck. All while I was trying to push him off. I never directly used the word no, (I have anxiety), but I made it clear that I didn’t want it, that I was tired and he needed to take me home, and then, when he had me pinned against the car, I tried to push him off the entire time. My school, (a private college), thought it serious enough to go through the title-IX process, but my brain tells me it wasn’t actually sexual assault.

For reference, I was raised very Christian, and still hold on to my faith now, (I’m not saying that my upbringing was bad, btw!) But up until that point, other then being catcalled I hadn’t had any “suggestive” interaction with anyone. Could this be why I found it so traumatic?

Comment (depth 1):
Author: am707
Content: In our country, child abuse doesn't carry the weight that it may elsewhere. It's considered the norm and usually brushed off, so you learn to live with that. Even most forms of sexual assault aren't really taken seriously. There's no consequences for the abuser for the most part, but I'm struggling with what it means for me and how it's affecting me.

Content: Of course, you don’t have to force yourself. If you don’t feel like your circle of friends is supportive, it might be time to meet some new people. Therapists are professionals and know better than to point fingers like that, so i strongly recommend going that path if you feel comfortable. I wish you the best, and I’m genuinely sorry you had to go through such a thing.

Comment (depth 3):
Author: am707
Content: Thank you so much. Therapy is a difficult option right now because of the cost and also because I'm still not independent. I'm waiting to become independent financially so that I can get the help I need. Till then I have to tough it out I suppose.

Comment (depth 4):
Author: XXXORACLE
Content: In my country, there is a free therapy service for teenagers and kids, it was recommended to me by my school nurse. Maybe try looking for something similar, or a therapist covered by your insurance (if you have it)? If your parents ask, try dodging the question smoothly or making up an excuse.

Comment (depth 5):
Author: am707
Content: Our country doesn't have the system of insurance. You just pay the medical bills. It's difficult to go to a proper therapist without my parents' consent( I've tried, didn't go well). Been trying to save up to maybe try some of the online options like 7cups.

I am 18m and currently sitting my year 12 exams. Now I know three people who I believe have sexually assaulted me. 22f who I will call E, 18m who I’ll call L and 17m who I’ll call J.

E: so this is actually my 22 year old sister. So back when I was young (around 5-6) my sister used to take me out to her room (she was about 9-10) and she was force me to kiss her and she would grab my butt. She did this for multiple months over that year. 

J: so I will do J next as he is the quickest. So J and I have known each other for 13 years now roughly, we have basically grown up together. So when I was in year 7, (about 12–13). J walked up behind me in one of my classes and started squeezing my butt. Now I told him to stop which he did for about a week before he did it again. This happened over and over again for the next 2 years. He stopped for 2 years then for the last year and a half, he has been doing stuff like grabbing me from behind, he also acts like he is going to kiss me.J last year, he walked up behind me while I was talking to a teacher about feedback for my assignment and he full force slapped my ass.

L: so L I have known for only 6 years. In year 7, L used to tell me about weird stuff. Then in year 9, he started to grab my butt as well when he walked behind me. He got much worse in year 10 as he started to not only grab my ass but he also stuck his fingers up my ass at one point. I hated it when he did that. Then in year 11, he started to grab me from behind on my shoulders and he used to slam his crotch into my ass. Even when I told him to stop he kept going. He also used to say to me, “I am going to touch you now.” Or “are you ready to be touched tonight.” The scary part is that L knows where I live. L also randomly grabs my thighs during classes and he will caress my inner thighs. I told him so many times to stop grabbing me and he kept doing it. He also grabbed my shorts and my d*ck one during a class lesson. I couldn’t even focus on anything for the rest of that school week. 

This has been hard for me to talk about. My parents don’t believe me when I am honest. They always allow my sisters to share their experiences but not me. I am the only son out of my parents 4 kids. This again is the first time I have ever spoken about this.

Title: Does this count as coercion?
Body: I'm sorry for adding to the list of ""was this sexual assault"" questions but I am going out of my mind here trying to figure out if I am overreacting or being overdramatic.  I am totally lost and just need some objective outside perspective.

Content: Alright. Let me see if framing this with a different crime might help because your therapist was/is right. This is definitely coersion, sexual assault, and rape. Whatever you want to call it, it qualifies as any and all of the above, but clearly that's going to be a hard pill for you to swallow. 

Let's say that your friend wanted to take your TV home with him. You told him you wanted to keep your TV right where it is, but he insists on trying to take the tv. You offer him your computer monitor. You don't want him to take that either, but at least you're a little more comfortable with the idea of him having your computer monitor than taking your whole tv. He rejects this idea and insists on taking the tv and now he keeps trying the door handle, but you've locked it. He decides that doesn't matter. He'll just kick the door down and take the tv anyways. You relent and offer him the tv on the condition that he let's you unlock the door first. That's still theft right? He just robbed you. Same thing goes for sex. If you offered it or you agreed to let him take it when he asked it would be a gift. If he insists on taking it that's theft/rape in this case.

Content: Thank you for this. I really appreciate you taking the time to write that explanation out and it does help so much.  

You are right that it is a hard pill to swallow. Growing up as a woman you hear high rape/assault statistics over and over again, but I always thought ""it could never happen to me."" I think I'm still caught in that.  It never occured to me that I would join those statistics. Thank you again for your comment. I hope you have a wonderful new years 🧡

Content: That's where everybody starts out. The rose colored glasses that make the world seem safe are ever present. Then, one day they crack and the real world becomes much harder to ignore. That sudden jerk from the everyday to what feels like a battlefield or maybe even a horror film/action movie takes a while to catch up with you. It's all so confusing and disorienting. What's safe? What was really a red flag we couldn't see through the rosey tint of the glasses? How do we fit into this new more dangerous world? How do we avoid it happening again? If bad things happen to bad people then am I bad? Or is the world callous and random and these kinds of things are just unavoidable and completely at the mercy of luck? How dangerous is the new world now that we're in it? Is it as dangerous as it seems or am I just on hypervigilance mode all the time now? There's a lot to manage when the realization sticks and not much of it is very fun. Especially when you have a fear response or your body betrays your mind and parts of the assault feel good. All of that just confuses things way worse. The good/bad news is, you're not alone. Many people have gone through this before you, many have gone through it after you, and many more will go through it one day. Each and every last one of those people can help you to sort things out if and when you're comfortable enough to ask a question. I've been around the block enough times myself that I generally have at least some idea how to help or what other's are going through and there's never any judgement on my part. And if you're not comfortable with asking me or taking my advice specifically there's a couple thousand people on here to help you out. It's rough, but you'll make it through to the other side. Have a great week and a fantastic new year.

After he says that I go from sitting on a chair across him to sitting right next to him in his bed. Right when I got next to him he starts touching all over me sexually. I start getting nervous and uncomfortable. I try to push myself away from him but he pulls me in and continues on with sexual touch. I said ""I don't think I can do this"" and instead of stopping he pulls me closer and kisses me. That's when I got really uncomfortable and told him I'm not ready for this.

He continues trying to pursuade me and once again I say I don't want to but he pressed me against himself and kisses me again and tries taking off my shirt again. I was really uncomfortable and finally after multiple failed attempts to convince me to sleep with him he lets me go. I sit across from him just staring at him because it was hard to process what just happened. As I sit across from him he ""apologizes."" He says ""my bad, my bad"". He hands me the blunt and I stayed until it was finished.

The whole time he was kissing me, fondling me, taking off my shirt I continuously told him Im 16 and it doesn't seem right. He continued on and said he doesn't care and that I'm ""mature."" He said he was close enough and can sometimes have a ""teenage mindset"" so it's not a big deal. I felt straight violated. I was completely shocked. When I finally leave his apartment he hugs me out the door and looks at me and goes ""we're cool right, you're not going to tell anyone and no one's going to know."" I tell him I won't say anything. Does this count as SA even though we didn't end up having sex. Also it's kind of my fault for going to his place in the first place like what was I expecting? I'm also scared now. We go to the same job and as of right now it's only been a couple days and we haven't seen each other at work yet. Everything is weird now. I don't know if I should report him.

He also has my address since he sent an Uber there to pick me up. It's scary that he would be okay hooking up with a 16 yr old.

He’s 20 and wanting to get with you knowing well that you’re only 16, he’s a predator and he uses all the methods of grooming.

Another friend of mine said rape about the second incident as well and I had a hard time thinking of it that way because it didn't go until ""completion"".",1,1755394895,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ms2e0e/was_this_sa_or_a_misunderstanding/n93uef3/,True,Was this SA or a misunderstanding?,Emotional_Low_3373,"My ex boyfriend crossed sexual boundaries multiple times with me. He interprets both occasions as ""misunderstandings"" and I feel like they fall under the umbrella of SA. 

The first involved me saying no to sex (very clearly - ""I don't want to have sex""), and then pulling away from cuddling & kissing. He then continued to grope me on my boobs and vag (over clothes) and try to make out with me, and when I confronted him about it later his excuse was that he ""wasn't trying to have sex"". He also blamed his behavior on being on mushrooms (mind you, it was a microdose - he wasn't tripping). He also didn't clarify before the groping and kissing that that was all he wanted. He just went right back to kissing/groping a few mins after I had said no. 

The second time, we were fooling around on the floor before leaving for a dinner with a friend. I say ""fooling around"", but really he was groping me relentlessly and I was rolling my eyes but kind of going along with it. It's all a blur, but suddenly he was flipping me over (I had been on my stomach and scrolling on my phone), and my pants were coming off. I did go along with this, but his pants were coming off too and I said in quick succession ""I don't think I'm ready yet"", and ""I'm not there yet"" because I realized he was going straight for penetration with no real foreplay other than groping me on the ass. He then touched me (to see if I was wet - he later used that as one of his excuses - he supposedly thought I meant I wasn't wet enough, which I still think isn't consent because a bodily response isn't consent and I was verbalizing my hesitation), and said ""oh, you ARE there"". And proceeded to try to penetrate me. At this point I was completely frozen because it was happening so fast, and him trying to penetrate me was hurting me. I went into freeze/fawn mode and tried to help him penetrate me, because I thought ""if this is going to happen I at least don't want it to hurt"". This didn't work because clearly my body wasn't ready at all. Later, in the shower, I realized that this part tore my vagina a little bit. He stopped after about 20-30 seconds of half-penetrating me when I was in clear pain and because he couldn't get it all the way in. He then acted like nothing happened and I was in total shock. 

There were a couple other instances where he kissed me after I had said no, and there were times where I wasn't responding to his sexual advances (arms at my side, barely kissing back) but he would keep going and doing the things he knew would turn me on, until I finally responded. He also ""jokingly"" groped me all the time even when I would roll my eyes and back away. He would also pretend to fuck me from behind if I bent down to put shoes on, etc. Just generally disrespectful behavior, imo. 

Talking to him directly about both of these incidents resulted in full meltdowns, with him telling me I ""can't"" leave him because of this, otherwise he wouldn't be able to live with himself anymore. He said ""I can't see myself as the kind of person who would do that"". He kept repeating that he wouldn't want to live with himself anymore if I left him because of this.

Title: Was this SA or a misunderstanding?
Body: My ex boyfriend crossed sexual boundaries multiple times with me. He interprets both occasions as ""misunderstandings"" and I feel like they fall under the umbrella of SA. 

The first involved me saying no to sex (very clearly - ""I don't want to have sex""), and then pulling away from cuddling & kissing. He then continued to grope me on my boobs and vag (over clothes) and try to make out with me, and when I confronted him about it later his excuse was that he ""wasn't trying to have sex"". He also blamed his behavior on being on mushrooms (mind you, it was a microdose - he wasn't tripping). He also didn't clarify before the groping and kissing that that was all he wanted. He just went right back to kissing/groping a few mins after I had said no. 

The second time, we were fooling around on the floor before leaving for a dinner with a friend. I say ""fooling around"", but really he was groping me relentlessly and I was rolling my eyes but kind of going along with it. It's all a blur, but suddenly he was flipping me over (I had been on my stomach and scrolling on my phone), and my pants were coming off. I did go along with this, but his pants were coming off too and I said in quick succession ""I don't think I'm ready yet"", and ""I'm not there yet"" because I realized he was going straight for penetration with no real foreplay other than groping me on the ass. He then touched me (to see if I was wet - he later used that as one of his excuses - he supposedly thought I meant I wasn't wet enough, which I still think isn't consent because a bodily response isn't consent and I was verbalizing my hesitation), and said ""oh, you ARE there"". And proceeded to try to penetrate me. At this point I was completely frozen because it was happening so fast, and him trying to penetrate me was hurting me. I went into freeze/fawn mode and tried to help him penetrate me, because I thought ""if this is going to happen I at least don't want it to hurt"". This didn't work because clearly my body wasn't ready at all. Later, in the shower, I realized that this part tore my vagina a little bit. He stopped after about 20-30 seconds of half-penetrating me when I was in clear pain and because he couldn't get it all the way in. He then acted like nothing happened and I was in total shock. 

There were a couple other instances where he kissed me after I had said no, and there were times where I wasn't responding to his sexual advances (arms at my side, barely kissing back) but he would keep going and doing the things he knew would turn me on, until I finally responded. He also ""jokingly"" groped me all the time even when I would roll my eyes and back away. He would also pretend to fuck me from behind if I bent down to put shoes on, etc. Just generally disrespectful behavior, imo. 

Talking to him directly about both of these incidents resulted in full meltdowns, with him telling me I ""can't"" leave him because of this, otherwise he wouldn't be able to live with himself anymore. He said ""I can't see myself as the kind of person who would do that"". He kept repeating that he wouldn't want to live with himself anymore if I left him because of this. Both times, I froze so much because of his reaction that I had to comfort HIM about it, and minimize what had happened so that he would calm down. He also blamed it on being autistic and not picking up on cues, he mentioned a conversation we had about me wanting him to dom me (but we didn't talk about this right before the second incident, we talked about it WEEKS before and then never had another convo about it).

Is there something wrong with me?

Around ten years ago, I (now 32F) was in a relationship with a man 16 years older than me.

I remember that I really liked him for a long time before we started dating. He wasn't keen on the idea at all because of the age gap, but after a few years of being friends, we eventually started dating.

I was delighted to be in a relationship with him. I had wanted it for so long. We were both Christians, so having sex was completely off the table, but it didn't stop us from doing other things.

One night, he was staying at my house. He was going to sleep in my room, and I was going to sleep in my sisters room with her.

I remember I snuck back into my room to see him. We fooled around a bit, and I fell asleep. 

I woke up a few hours later, and he was awake. That's when he told me that he had tried putting a finger in me when I was sleeping.

It didn't bother me at the time, it just left me feeling a bit odd because he was telling me he did this and I had no recollection. At the time, I was more curious than anything due my complete inexperience with men. 

Anyway, long story short, we split up maybe a year later. He became quite obsessive, and it took years for him to leave me alone.

I got married to another man, who I love dearly and who I now have a family with, and my ex even showed up at the wedding.

The thing is, until recently, I didn't think about this incident at all. That was until my husband told me about a guy at his work who was charged for doing the exact same thing to a girl while she slept.

I didn't associate it with being wrong, and now I'm feeling really weird(?) It's the only word I can use to describe it.

I feel kind of grossed out, but not that upset. Kind of because I don't actually remember it happening. But that makes me feel like there's something deeply wrong with me. 

I told my best friend, who knows my ex, and she said it was sexual assault. I built up the courage to tell my husband, and he said the same.

If I was sexually assaulted, surely I'd feel...more???

Am I messed up in the head? 

I just watched a TV series where SA and the aftermath was a major theme, and now I can't stop thinking about this.

Can anyone give me advice? Help me make sense of this? Was I sexually assaulted? Is it too late to be mulling this over?

I'm scared that me thinking about this now is going to cause deep rooted issues.

Or maybe these feelings have been rooted since it happened and I'm just starting to feel them

I was 12 years old and my older sister who was 16 at the time had a friend (let’s call her Rose) over to spend the night. The three of us went swimming in our pool and Rose was very touchy the whole time. Nothing overtly sexual, but definitely flirty. After this we went inside and watched a scary movie. Rose sat by me and anytime the movie got scary she would move closer. Eventually we were side by side under a blanket. Next thing I know she is caressing my leg. I didn’t try to stop her because I was 12 and a hot high school chick was touching me. She got progressively closer to my crotch, until eventually she straight up grabbed my dick and started playing with it. I just sat there frozen the entire time. Part of me was enjoying it, but I was also kinda scared and shocked. She then grabbed my hand and put it on her boob. She continued this until the end of the movie.

I’m not sure if this is assault or just two teenagers doing what teenagers do. We were both minors, but I was only 12. looking back I feel like that’s so young. She was a sophomore in high school I feel like she should have know better. I remember enjoying it and begging exited that it happened so it’s not like it wasn’t consensual. I’m just not sure how to feel about this. Was she preying on a younger boy or was it just part of of growing up??

Content: As someone who was actually raped aka a man forcefully put his penis in me when I was 6, if you go to court and say “I didn’t try to stop  it because it was a hot high school chick”, you both were minors a sophomore in high school is what 15 16? She’s not an adult and they won’t try her as one. That’s only four years older that isn’t much. It’s normal for high schoolers to date middle schoolers even now a days. Rape is when someone has sex with you against your will, sounds like you were just chilling letting the high school chick touch you’re dick, just because you were 12 doesn’t mean it was rape.

Content: Just because his experience of sexual assault doesn’t match yours doesn’t make it invalid.  Recognising his assault doesn’t lessen the severity of yours.  The courts are unlikely to find his assailant guilty of a crime, however if a conviction were required before we could class something as an assault, then there would only be somewhere under 2,000 rapes a year in the US.  We know from the report numbers there are more like 50 times more than that reported, and reported rapes are just the tip of the iceberg.

Supporting other victims of less directly traumatic assaults doesn’t make your victimisation seem less serious, but more.

Content: Not invalidating his, simply stating that it sounds like bullshit. Don’t act like you don’t know good and well everyone these days is trying to say they were raped for attention since everyone else seems to have been actually raped. I had a bunch of dudes try to touch me when I was younger was that rape no it’s not. People know when they’ve been raped it’s fucking traumatic.

Content: That may be your experience, but many young children don’t feel violated by their decades-older molesters until they later realise how much damage was done psychologically, how far from normal their perceptions had become.  It doesn’t *have* to feel violating at the time for it to be rape.  Discounting rapes that involve grooming of children by pedophiles is a backwards leap IMO.  Given the ages OP mentioned, certainly it was an offence of a lesser degree than some, and many rapes are worse, more violating, more harmful emotionally and physically than others.  Still, they were molested nonetheless.

I’m 21 and when my flatmates 16 y o sister came to stay at our flat for the weekend, I viewed her as a kid (bc she is one)- we cooked her dinner, and tried to show her the city. We didn’t drink or smoke with her bc we’re adults and she’s a kid! We felt a sense of parental duty to her! 

Not only this, but this man seems like he had sex in mind from the start, which is why he gave you weed, I guess to make you a bit ‘looser’ and in the mood. 

All of these red flags aside, he deliberately ignored your explicit verbal consent, multiple times. I am so sorry this happened to you. 

Personally I think that yes, you should report him. He gave drugs to a 16 y o and sexually assaulted you. If you don’t want to go down the reporting route which I agree can be scary and uncomfortable, I would recommend trying to access support for yourself.

Story time.... I (16f) was texting with a (20m)that I knew from work. He invited me over to smoke and I agreed. Looking back I realized that he must've taken some of our chat sexual even though I had no intentions of being sexual. The ""sexual"" comments I'm talking about would be how I said I would shower and get ready and I take it he must of thought I was freshening up and getting prepared for sex. If I had known he wanted to hook up I definitely wouldn't have gone but me being stupid and naive I thought we were gonna have a chill smoke sesh and that's it yk. So anyway he pays for my Uber over to his apartment and takes me to his room. At this point we're talking and chilling smoking nic while he rolls and prepares the blunt. It's ready so we start smoking and he goes ""do you know how to do a ghost?"" I answered no and he's like ""come over let me show you."" After he says that I go from sitting on a chair across him to sitting right next to him in his bed. Right when I got next to him he starts touching all over me sexually. I start getting nervous and uncomfortable. I try to push myself away from him but he pulls me in and continues on with sexual touch. I said ""I don't think I can do this"" and instead of stopping he pulls me closer and kisses me. That's when I got really uncomfortable and told him I'm not ready for this. He says ""please it'll be alright"" ""c'mon you just look so good."" I tell him I don't think I can do this and still he doesn't stop. He starts taking off my shirt and I felt so uncomfortable I pulled my shirt right back on.  He continues trying to pursuade me and once again I say I don't want to but he pressed me against himself and kisses me again and tries taking off my shirt again. I was really uncomfortable and finally after multiple failed attempts to convince me to sleep with him he lets me go.

Title: Im confused
Body: I believe I've been sexually assaulted. Story time.... I (16f) was texting with a (20m)that I knew from work. He invited me over to smoke and I agreed. Looking back I realized that he must've taken some of our chat sexual even though I had no intentions of being sexual. The ""sexual"" comments I'm talking about would be how I said I would shower and get ready and I take it he must of thought I was freshening up and getting prepared for sex. If I had known he wanted to hook up I definitely wouldn't have gone but me being stupid and naive I thought we were gonna have a chill smoke sesh and that's it yk. So anyway he pays for my Uber over to his apartment and takes me to his room. At this point we're talking and chilling smoking nic while he rolls and prepares the blunt. It's ready so we start smoking and he goes ""do you know how to do a ghost?"" I answered no and he's like ""come over let me show you."" After he says that I go from sitting on a chair across him to sitting right next to him in his bed. Right when I got next to him he starts touching all over me sexually. I start getting nervous and uncomfortable. I try to push myself away from him but he pulls me in and continues on with sexual touch. I said ""I don't think I can do this"" and instead of stopping he pulls me closer and kisses me. That's when I got really uncomfortable and told him I'm not ready for this. He says ""please it'll be alright"" ""c'mon you just look so good."" I tell him I don't think I can do this and still he doesn't stop. He starts taking off my shirt and I felt so uncomfortable I pulled my shirt right back on.  He continues trying to pursuade me and once again I say I don't want to but he pressed me against himself and kisses me again and tries taking off my shirt again. I was really uncomfortable and finally after multiple failed attempts to convince me to sleep with him he lets me go. I sit across from him just staring at him because it was hard to process what just happened. As I sit across from him he ""apologizes."" He says ""my bad, my bad"". He hands me the blunt and I stayed until it was finished. It just felt so awkward and I didn't know how to leave because I was just processing how this actually happened.Also if anyone is wondering yes he knew I was 16 and with every move I kept saying things like""I'm only 16"" and ""but I'm a lot younger than you"" ""I can't do this I'm 16""etc. Reminder he was 20 and knew I was 16 even before going to his place as I told him though text.

Content: YES this is SA. It’s a red flag from the start that he wanted to smoke with a 16 year old, tf? I’m 21 and when my flatmates 16 y o sister came to stay at our flat for the weekend, I viewed her as a kid (bc she is one)- we cooked her dinner, and tried to show her the city. We didn’t drink or smoke with her bc we’re adults and she’s a kid! We felt a sense of parental duty to her! 

Not only this, but this man seems like he had sex in mind from the start, which is why he gave you weed, I guess to make you a bit ‘looser’ and in the mood. 

All of these red flags aside, he deliberately ignored your explicit verbal consent, multiple times. I am so sorry this happened to you. 

Personally I think that yes, you should report him. He gave drugs to a 16 y o and sexually assaulted you. If you don’t want to go down the reporting route which I agree can be scary and uncomfortable, I would recommend trying to access support for yourself. Some charities give free therapy for victims of SA. See if you can tell your parents or anyone you trust.","Information support, Emotional support, Network support, Group interactions",True,sillygirlkkkkkk,0,[deleted],False,,"Information support, Emotional support, Network support, Seeking support",title_only,YES,YES,NO,YES,NO,YES,NO,NO

I couldn’t go on the trip since i had work, so i was staying home to house sit and feed our animals. My stepdad recently put up new cameras outside so I didn’t see anything wrong with him positioning one outside my window. Come to find out the very next day, I had my boyfriend stay over and he found that the surveillance camera that was ran from outside my window and into my room was being powered by one of those spy camera power blocks. 

For context, my relationship with my stepdad hasn’t always been the best and we tend to butt heads a lot. He’s said a lot of questionable things in the past that i’ve written off because he’s my dad and i would never think he intended to be inappropriate or harmful. He’s been in my life since i was 8 years old. Of course I’m second guessing everything now that i’ve found this camera. It was positioned to point directly at my bedroom door from the far wall, so it has direct view of my entire room, which i change in. 

I tried desperately to rationalize it and think it was maybe a mistake, like he grabbed the wrong charger box. Or maybe he was just trying to look for intruders. But really there is no excuse for putting a camera in MY bedroom. the camera even had an SD card in it. I’m beyond devastated. My stepdad even suggested i invite my boyfriend over to while they’re gone so i have someone here, which is something he would never do considering he’s made it clear before he doesn’t want him over when no one is home because he doesn’t want us ‘fucking in his home’. My boyfriend and I are going to go through the SD card to see if there is anything on it.

I’m at a complete loss at how to even bring this up to my mom. I confided in my aunt and uncle since they live close by and they have been very supportive of me having a conversation with my mom about it. This whole situation is extremely upsetting, I at least have some family to support me as i navigate this but i don’t even know how to bring this up to my mom. This is obviously going to change everything. She had my five year old half brother with him. 

My mind is racing with the consequences this is going to have on our family. Has anyone that has been in a similar situation have advice? How can i do this without causing extreme damage to the family (although that may be impossible). Thank you in advance.

TLDR; i found a hidden camera that my stepdad put in my room, how do i bring this up to my mom?

UPDATE(1/?):

I don’t want to make a whole new thread since i want to make a new update when my parents get back monday, but i want to thank everyone for all the advice. i went to the police station tonight and filed a police report and turned in the spy camera with the SD card. The officer said this is a serious offense and i will likely get a call early next week from an investigator due to the severity of the situation. I’m planning on telling my mother about the police report after we have a conversation about this on monday, with my aunt and uncle present. 

As for people messaging me about my profile: thank you for reminding me to delete personal information. Please please do not dox or try to seek any sort of justice for me as this may affect my case. Respect my privacy during this time please as it may be crucial during this investigation.

This was the hardest thing i ever had to do, but whatever this shit was, it’s ending with me. I hope i can get justice for myself and any other victims who may have been violated by him since this will be heavily investigated and the officer said it will likely be looked into further (such as search warrants and looking for more SD cards). i’m hanging on by a thread but the support i have is what’s keeping me together. i’m staying with my boyfriend tonight to keep out of the house. Thanks again for all the love and supportive messages. I’ll update again soon.

UPDATE (2/?)

it’s the next morning and once my boyfriend wakes up we’re going back to my house today to look for any more secret cameras (either in the bathroom or my brothers rooms) so i can submit it for more evidence. i’m iffy about searching my parents room for more evidence as it’s likely he has a hidden camera in there to see me do it. still on the fence about having a police officer search the house, if i do i’ll be sure to update after i’m finished and in a safe place. my aunt has offered to come with me to help me search.

again, thank you everyone for the support. i’m trying as best i can to do this the right way and get as much done with the time i have left. i’m mentally and emotionally drained but i’ll be seeking resources once all of this is said and done. i’m reading everyone’s comments so i’m taking all the advice i can get.

UPDATE (3/?)

i probably won’t be able to update for a few days since today is the day that i talk to my mom, but i just wanted to share the plan i made and hopes for what happens today.

after talking with my aunt, uncle, boyfriend, and my cousin who is a civil lawyer, i’ve decided that i will speak to my mom in a separate location from my stepdad. most likely i’ll have her meet me somewhere outside of our home. i’ll have my aunt with me and this is where i’ll explain everything to her: the camera, past uncomfortable experiences i’ve had with my stepdad that i originally brushed off because he was my dad, video footage of him deliberately setting it up and angling it, and footage of me in my room. im praying she understands why i had to go to my aunt instead of her considering she was not in town and i was worried for her safety if i told her what happened. (she was stuck with him and my brothers about 4 hours away for the weekend) 

i’m hoping with my aunt there and her being away from my stepdad that it’ll prevent her from reacting out of anger and search for him and escalate the situation then and there, and i hope my aunt can provide some support for myself and her. i’m prepared for her to go through the same processes i went through such as reasoning and denial, but with the evidence there’s no possible way she can deny it. i’m preparing myself for the worst. i just hope that i can be strong for her and support her as this all hits her like it did me. 

i will not be returning home or facing him today. my boyfriend will be on standby to pick up my brothers if needed since my aunt has offered for them to stay with us so my mom can talk to my stepdad without them there. i’ll ask my mom to meet me and of course, not tell my stepdad about the circumstances. maybe she can tell him she’s going to the grocery store. i don’t want him getting any hints that she could be meeting
with me. 

i know i’ve said it a lot but i truly do appreciate the support system i have not only with my family but here too. this has been a nightmare but hearing everyone’s stories about this, proving it’s way too common, is what is helping me get through this and pushing me to do the right thing. not only am i a victim in this but my boyfriend as well and god knows who else. the confrontation won’t happen for about another 7 hours so i’m the meantime i’ll be reading over comments and preparing myself for what comes today. thank you guys.","Original Post:

I would gather evidence, as already stated. My concern is how long has he been doing this and how many people are affected.

Content: i’m very concerned about this as well. i have two brothers who are minors and he’s been in my life for over 14 years now so who’s to say he hasn’t recorded me before or even them. or even distributed it. it’s so terribly devastating to come to terms with him being this evil. he even installed these cameras while i was asleep so there’s no doubt he was hoping i wouldn’t notice.

1jv8dfu,,relationship_advice,mm86ksb,t3_1jv8dfu,0,[deleted],"First of all, everyone reading this knows that your husband was wrong to take advantage of you in your state.  However, you don't seem to own anything in the series of choices you made that lead you to this state to be taken advantage of.

Your first mistake was choosing to have your first experience with edibles away from a safe environment.  Your second mistake is two-fold but centers on this ""idea"" that you have no autonomy and must (A) accept drinking challenges, and (B) accept an insistence that you ""finish"" the edible.

YOU DID NOT HAVE TO DO ANY OF THOSE THINGS.

So, that is the part of this situation . . . if you will . . . the fostering of the situation that you must own.

Granted, your husband is an a-hole and complicit in you getting in this state in which you lost your bodily autonomy.  He is also so very wrong to take advantage of you in that state.

Yes, you must talk to him about it.  If this is the second time that you have been encouraged to over-indulge in substances to the point of losing bodily autonomy and he has then taken advantage of you, this is a very big problem.  

If you cannot control your anxiety to discuss this and get him to understand how he was wrong, and agree to never do this again, then at a minimum you need to stop drinking and using mind-altering substances because you have neither the maturity to use them responsibly nor the ability to exert the word ""no"" when you start.",1,1744212694,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1jv8dfu/my_22f_husband_27m_took_advantage_of_my_body/mm86ksb/,False,"My (22F) husband (27m) took advantage of my body while I was high, how do I confront him about it?

I’m going to skip the details here but I ended up freezing and just laying there freaking out feeling like i was dying.

I remember just laying there wondering why he was doing this, i felt like i was dying and he didjt care, i kept thinking “is this SA? This feels bad, i just want it to stop,” but i couldnt say anything.

He then left me in that bedroom alone where i slept for 12 hours straight. He didnt check on me once. When i was sober i just felt dirty, i kept thinking about what happened.

I’m going to skip the details here but I ended up freezing and just laying there freaking out feeling like i was dying. He eventually stopped because he was “frustrated” because i “wasnt enjoying myself”. I remember just laying there wondering why he was doing this, i felt like i was dying and he didjt care, i kept thinking “is this SA? This feels bad, i just want it to stop,” but i couldnt say anything.

He then left me in that bedroom alone where i slept for 12 hours straight. He didnt check on me once. When i was sober i just felt dirty, i kept thinking about what happened. I love my husband but unfortunately there was another time where he made me feel unsafe in this sort of way. I dont know how to talk to him about it as its been so long now. Is it even worth bringing up. I have so much anxiety just thinking about it.

Content: First of all, everyone reading this knows that your husband was wrong to take advantage of you in your state.  However, you don't seem to own anything in the series of choices you made that lead you to this state to be taken advantage of.

Your first mistake was choosing to have your first experience with edibles away from a safe environment.  Your second mistake is two-fold but centers on this ""idea"" that you have no autonomy and must (A) accept drinking challenges, and (B) accept an insistence that you ""finish"" the edible.

YOU DID NOT HAVE TO DO ANY OF THOSE THINGS.

So, that is the part of this situation . . . if you will . . . the fostering of the situation that you must own.

Granted, your husband is an a-hole and complicit in you getting in this state in which you lost your bodily autonomy.  He is also so very wrong to take advantage of you in that state.

Yes, you must talk to him about it.  If this is the second time that you have been encouraged to over-indulge in substances to the point of losing bodily autonomy and he has then taken advantage of you, this is a very big problem.  

If you cannot control your anxiety to discuss this and get him to understand how he was wrong, and agree to never do this again, then at a minimum you need to stop drinking and using mind-altering substances because you have neither the maturity to use them responsibly nor the ability to exert the word ""no"" when you start.",Information support,True,Low_Yogurtcloset_888,0,[deleted],False,,"Information support, Emotional support, Seeking support",full_body_fallback,YES,YES,NO,NO,NO,YES,NO,NO

Eventually the relationship ended. They got sick of me and I’m glad for it. I was depressed as fuck as the time but now I look back I’m very happy. They exploited me at a time when I was vunerable because I was in a terrible position with family and exams and my best friend also manipulating and abandoning me.

I met my boyfriend when I was 18 online, but we didn’t meet in person until a year later, we only video chatted, texted, and called frequently. I wanted to wait until we met in person to decide if we’d make things official, but he was very persistent, he asked me everyday to officially date for about 3 weeks, so I agreed, because I was genuinely interested in him and wanted to see where things would lead.

As a preface, I had told him before we met that I didn’t want sexual things to happen. I noticed in person that he was very touchy and affectionate, more so than I would’ve been since it was so early on in the relationship, but it didn’t seem to be in an overbearing way. Around our fourth date, after the day was over and it was dark outside, he pulled me into the backseat of his car and started to try to reach under my pants, and then under my underwear, etc, while kissing me. While he was doing this I was really nervous because it was my first time and it was also way too soon for me to want to do that. I also have a hard time hiding my facial expressions, so people can read me easily, so I would be really surprised if he didn’t see that I was anxious and uncomfortable. But I didn’t verbally tell him no.
While he was doing it, I would push his hand away and look at him uncomfortably, and then we would just sit for a bit and talk, and then he would try to do it again, and it would all repeat.

He also moved my hand onto his crotch and I would yank it back, and then he would pull it back over again. It’s hard for me to remember everything that happened, but I remember him laughing like I was being silly, and it was a game. And I remember him saying, “(My name), it’s not scary, you’re so scared of it, come on.” And I remember him making sad eyes at me like he was hurt, and feeling guilty like I did something wrong that was hurting him. At one point he asked me if I had done this before and when I said no, he apologized and said he didn’t know and then we cuddled for a few minutes. Then he moved my hand again, essentially guiding it to jack him off, before I pulled away, again. This happened on and off for a couple of hours. It almost felt like he thought he was dealing with a stubborn child rather than a nonconsenting and inexperienced partner. 

Before our next date he told me he was going to go down on me, and I asked him not to, saying that I really wasn’t ready for it yet, and he told me that he wouldn’t, and then at the end of the date he did it. Later that night he acknowledged that I said I didn’t want him to and apologized (without me bringing it up.) He also asked me several times each date to go down on him after I told him I didn’t want to and was uncomfortable with it. 

I processed this several months after the fact, as at that time I was so confused about the whole situation that I didn’t know how to respond to it (I’m also inexperienced with sex and the concepts of consent and coercion.) When I brought all of these things up to him, he apologized and said that he raped me, and said that he was a bad person. I responded that he didn’t, and that he wasn’t bad, and spent the rest of the night consoling him because he has a tendency to get depressed and I was very afraid he would hurt himself. 

I brought it up several months later because I kept getting flashbacks and I was bothered that I didn’t understand what had happened with my partner, who otherwise has treated me extremely well and has always showered me in love. The second time I got some more clarity about it, but there was also arguing, he became very angry that I brought it up again and asked me how I dare question his intentions after all he’s done for me, and how he was planning on proposing and he’s only ever been good to me. He said that he didn’t rape me and did think I wanted it, (to clarify I never accused him of rape, I just asked for clarity on the situation.) And then he said he just thought I was scared and he wanted to show me it wasn’t scary. He said he was pissed and disgusted that I would question him about it, saying that I knew he would never do anything to hurt me, and that I was just using this as an excuse to find fault in him and leave him because I wasn’t ready for a serious relationship. After this conversation I told him I needed space to process things, and he told me I was abusing him by making him think I’ll leave.

So now I’m left in a place of confusion. I’ve debated whether I didn’t do enough, whether I should’ve loudly told him no or shoved him off harder. I wonder if he knew that I was saying no and didn’t care, or if he genuinely somehow misinterpreted things. 

I think about what I should’ve done differently, and try to understand why things happened the way they did. But what I do know is that in those moments I was afraid and confused. I couldn’t wrap my head around why my nonverbal no didn’t matter, and that it was being ignored by someone that I trusted. And it made me worry that even if I tried harder, nothing would make it stop. And it might get worse. I debate whether it was due to my bad communication, him just being a more sexually driven person but not intending to cross my boundaries, or whether he really did know he was hurting me, and didn’t care. I had a dream about it recently, so now I’m thinking about what it all means again. I care about this person a lot and it’s difficult for me to process this and try to understand it.

I haven’t talked to many people about this situation, and I’m not sure if it’ll go completely unread, but it’s at least helpful to articulate my thoughts on it.","Original Post:

Content: This guy sounds bad OP.  If it's not outright rape, he's at least been pushing you to do things he knew you weren't ready for.  His initial sadness saying he raped you sounds like a ploy to get you to reverse it and say he didnt.  I think his most recent reaction of anger is anger that it hasn't gone away and he's trying to make you the bad guy for doubting him.  He's suddenly angry when he previously felt so guilty?  That makes no sense.

Therapy is what my mom suggested too, but I really think that I'm okay now.
Thank you so much for your response 💜💜",2,1621262517,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/ne6kgh/tw_rpe_sucide_abuse_how_do_i_know_if_i_was_rped/gyg7kfe/,True,"*TW: R*pe, su*cide, abuse* How do I know if I was r!ped?",[deleted],"This seems like a fairly simple question, but for me, it isn't. 
I was in an abusive relationship at the age of 14-15. I'm now 18. I used to dismiss what happened (losing my virginity), but now I'm remembering more.
I blocked the majority of it out at the time because I was scared. Obviously, I'm not bringing it up now to gain sympathy, or ""ruin"" that guy's life. I'm just wondering if I was r*ped because of the details that I am now remembering.
I don't remember in part, I think, because it was too traumatizing for me. Here's what I remember:
The first time it happened, I told him no. He didn't listen. I thought it was my fault because I didn't say no directly. I was too scared (of him). Instead, I said something like, ""oh, your mom is going to be home soon, right?"" He then called his mom and confirmed that she was going to be out for another hour or so.
Second time, I remember that I felt bad. I had been turning him down for months. I was into the making out, but I wasn't ready. I do feel like that was taken from me.
Lastly, and this might be disturbing to some, I remember telling him to stop and crying because it hurt. He wouldn't stop. I told him to stop several times, I was bawling, but he laid on top of me.
After I broke up with this guy, he went to a mental hospital. He told me that he was going to overdose, so I called the cops. He had a warrant out for his arrest, too.

Title: *TW: R*pe, su*cide, abuse* How do I know if I was r!ped?
Body: This seems like a fairly simple question, but for me, it isn't. 
I was in an abusive relationship at the age of 14-15. I'm now 18. I used to dismiss what happened (losing my virginity), but now I'm remembering more.
I blocked the majority of it out at the time because I was scared. Obviously, I'm not bringing it up now to gain sympathy, or ""ruin"" that guy's life. I'm just wondering if I was r*ped because of the details that I am now remembering.
I don't remember in part, I think, because it was too traumatizing for me. Here's what I remember:
The first time it happened, I told him no. He didn't listen. I thought it was my fault because I didn't say no directly. I was too scared (of him). Instead, I said something like, ""oh, your mom is going to be home soon, right?"" He then called his mom and confirmed that she was going to be out for another hour or so.
Second time, I remember that I felt bad. I had been turning him down for months. I was into the making out, but I wasn't ready. I do feel like that was taken from me.
Lastly, and this might be disturbing to some, I remember telling him to stop and crying because it hurt. He wouldn't stop. I told him to stop several times, I was bawling, but he laid on top of me.
After I broke up with this guy, he went to a mental hospital. He told me that he was going to overdose, so I called the cops. He had a warrant out for his arrest, too.
He was very angry with me. I blocked all of his social media accounts, but he then bought 5 or 6 burner phones. He called me, my friends, and my family. This happened until I moved away and changed my number.
In the relationship, I remember that he would shove me. He yelled at me every. Single. Night. I always was crying because of something he said. 
Please, please don't make any jokes responding to this. I've heard it all. ""I don't blame him, you're so pretty!""

Therapy is what my mom suggested too, but I really think that I'm okay now.

Apparently as the night went out I had too much the drink and blacked out, even to the point where I was laying in my own vomit (I was filled in regarding this the next day, i didn’t even recall vomiting and had to ask if I threw up at all)

Somehow I end up in the shower and I hear someone come in, I look out, and see her in the bathroom closing the door, naked. 

Things are kind of hazy from this point on but i vaguely remember “hooking up” in the bathroom, in the backseat of my car, and the spare bedroom.

I remember her being frustrated that she couldn’t get me hard and I remember not really knowing what’s going on.

She says she only came into the bathroom to help me because I was falling in the tub and she wanted to help. So it doesn’t add up to me why she would’ve needed to be naked to do that? 

Earlier in the night I send an incoherent text (i can’t post an images here or i would post a screenshot), which i then showed my friend and my friend even commented “Yeah what, For her to read your texts like that, It’s clear that you were beyond drunk”

and they believe, as well as chatGPT believes, I was sexually assaulted but i’m having a hard time believing it.

I remember her being on top trying to get me hard and saying to put a baby in her. And I’m 99% sure we didn’t use protection but she says we did. 

We ended up hooking up in the bathroom, my car, and the spare bedroom.

When I asked her about the situation due to concerns regarding consent she said she was only in the bathroom because I was falling in the tub. She says when she tried to help me up that’s when I tried to kiss her. I don’t remember so that may be true but my question is why would she have needed to be naked to help me up? 

She then said I was bothering her all night and even had to tell me to stop trying to kiss her. She says she went to sleep in the spare bedroom, i wanted to come with her, and she told me no and turned me away.

She also says we used protection. But the thing is a specifically remember having sex in the spare bed and I specifically remember not using protection (because it was later in the night/morning when I was less drunk).

She also completely omitted the hookup in the backseat of the car in her retelling of the story, which I do remember. She was on top of me in the bathroom and in the backseat, and I vaguely remember her saying put a baby in me. 

After having this conversation with her responses were “ I don't like how this sound I took advantage of you cause that's DEFINITELY not the case”, “ LMFAO”, “Sorry to laugh but raping you is crazy”, and “Im actually offended”

I don’t remember initiating sex, I just remember kind of slowly regaining consciousness briefly while she was on top of me, but I couldn’t feel anything.

Again she did say I was coming onto her so maybe I asked for it? Based on her reply and how easily she dismissed it, it makes me feel like i’m overreacting or my memories are wrong.

Was this sexual assault? Am I overthinking? Just a drunk hookup? I don’t remember the actual act itself for the most part other than 5-10 second snippets sporadically. 

Sorry if this story is a little messy or incoherent but i’m just trying to piece everything together. I know my friend said it was sexual assault and so did chatGPT but for some reason i’m having a hard time believing that so I’m here on reddit to get more opinions. ","Original Post:

Content: It seems like it might be sexual assault to me. When you said no and she kept doing it she was ignoring your lack of consent. I’m sorry this happened that sounds like a really stressful situation. If you feel like you need to tell someone, do. It’s unfair on you as well as to her bf! Once again, I’m sorry. That’s a horrible situation to be in ❤️

I had a medical condition that made sex painful, and I told him this many times. He said I needed to be “broken in” so I wouldn’t feel the pain anymore.

He was very good at making it seem like he cared about what I was going through, but the pressure was constant and confusing. He once said, “If the specialty coffee shop is closed,” basically meaning me because he thought I was very beautiful, “then you should go to the one that is cheaper but open.” In other words, if I wasn’t ready for sex, he could just find someone else “even if uglier” (in his words) who was.

Even though he kept saying, “I don’t want you to do this if you’re not ready,” the way he acted didn’t match his words. He pushed for sex and certain acts like backdoor sex, even when I said no. Sometimes during sex, he would “accidentally” put it somewhere I didn’t want and keep going while I froze then would get angry if I would be upset about it saying I didnt say “no” in the moment even though I would say it in the beginning and in the moment I would be too shocked to say anything. He would sometimes laugh when putting it in the wrong hole as if it was a joke and then continue pretending he was making the mistake 2 times, 3 times in a raw. 

Once during my period, he said vaginal sex was “haram” because of his religion, but backdoor sex was allowed and when I said I dont think it is he lied about asking his spiritual coach about it. When I found out he lied to get what he wanted I cried so much.

Not to mention I would have backdoor sex because he would say manipulative things like “you know…sometimes you have some sexual things you like that if your partner doesnt fulfil you always wonder how it would be like to do it” (implying it makes someone want to cheat)

14c0udv,TemperatureAlone6712@1,relationship_advice,jpj2bzk,t1_jpj27ih,2,rico_muerte,Thank you,1,1687738077,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/14c0udv/i_21f_found_a_spy_camera_in_my_room_after_my_step/jpj2bzk/,False,I (21F) found a spy camera in my room after my step dad (36M) put a surveillance camera in my window,katiedababie,"My stepdad (36M) installed a surveillance camera positioned outside of my window to scan our backyard while him and my mother and two younger brothers go camping. I couldn’t go on the trip since i had work, so i was staying home to house sit and feed our animals. My stepdad recently put up new cameras outside so I didn’t see anything wrong with him positioning one outside my window. Come to find out the very next day, I had my boyfriend stay over and he found that the surveillance camera that was ran from outside my window and into my room was being powered by one of those spy camera power blocks. 

For context, my relationship with my stepdad hasn’t always been the best and we tend to butt heads a lot. He’s said a lot of questionable things in the past that i’ve written off because he’s my dad and i would never think he intended to be inappropriate or harmful. He’s been in my life since i was 8 years old. Of course I’m second guessing everything now that i’ve found this camera. It was positioned to point directly at my bedroom door from the far wall, so it has direct view of my entire room, which i change in. 

I tried desperately to rationalize it and think it was maybe a mistake, like he grabbed the wrong charger box. Or maybe he was just trying to look for intruders. But really there is no excuse for putting a camera in MY bedroom. the camera even had an SD card in it. I’m beyond devastated. My stepdad even suggested i invite my boyfriend over to while they’re gone so i have someone here, which is something he would never do considering he’s made it clear before he doesn’t want him over when no one is home because he doesn’t want us ‘fucking in his home’. My boyfriend and I are going to go through the SD card to see if there is anything on it.

I’m at a complete loss at how to even bring this up to my mom. I confided in my aunt and uncle since they live close by and they have been very supportive of me having a conversation with my mom about it. This whole situation is extremely upsetting, I at least have some family to support me as i navigate this but i don’t even know how to bring this up to my mom. This is obviously going to change everything. She had my five year old half brother with him. 

My mind is racing with the consequences this is going to have on our family. Has anyone that has been in a similar situation have advice? How can i do this without causing extreme damage to the family (although that may be impossible). Thank you in advance.

TLDR; i found a hidden camera that my stepdad put in my room, how do i bring this up to my mom?

UPDATE(1/?):

I don’t want to make a whole new thread since i want to make a new update when my parents get back monday, but i want to thank everyone for all the advice. i went to the police station tonight and filed a police report and turned in the spy camera with the SD card. The officer said this is a serious offense and i will likely get a call early next week from an investigator due to the severity of the situation. I’m planning on telling my mother about the police report after we have a conversation about this on monday, with my aunt and uncle present. 

As for people messaging me about my profile: thank you for reminding me to delete personal information. Please please do not dox or try to seek any sort of justice for me as this may affect my case. Respect my privacy during this time please as it may be crucial during this investigation.

This was the hardest thing i ever had to do, but whatever this shit was, it’s ending with me. I hope i can get justice for myself and any other victims who may have been violated by him since this will be heavily investigated and the officer said it will likely be looked into further (such as search warrants and looking for more SD cards). i’m hanging on by a thread but the support i have is what’s keeping me together. i’m staying with my boyfriend tonight to keep out of the house. Thanks again for all the love and supportive messages. I’ll update again soon.

UPDATE (2/?)

it’s the next morning and once my boyfriend wakes up we’re going back to my house today to look for any more secret cameras (either in the bathroom or my brothers rooms) so i can submit it for more evidence. i’m iffy about searching my parents room for more evidence as it’s likely he has a hidden camera in there to see me do it. still on the fence about having a police officer search the house, if i do i’ll be sure to update after i’m finished and in a safe place. my aunt has offered to come with me to help me search.

again, thank you everyone for the support. i’m trying as best i can to do this the right way and get as much done with the time i have left. i’m mentally and emotionally drained but i’ll be seeking resources once all of this is said and done. i’m reading everyone’s comments so i’m taking all the advice i can get.

UPDATE (3/?)

i probably won’t be able to update for a few days since today is the day that i talk to my mom, but i just wanted to share the plan i made and hopes for what happens today.

after talking with my aunt, uncle, boyfriend, and my cousin who is a civil lawyer, i’ve decided that i will speak to my mom in a separate location from my stepdad. most likely i’ll have her meet me somewhere outside of our home. i’ll have my aunt with me and this is where i’ll explain everything to her: the camera, past uncomfortable experiences i’ve had with my stepdad that i originally brushed off because he was my dad, video footage of him deliberately setting it up and angling it, and footage of me in my room. im praying she understands why i had to go to my aunt instead of her considering she was not in town and i was worried for her safety if i told her what happened. (she was stuck with him and my brothers about 4 hours away for the weekend) 

i’m hoping with my aunt there and her being away from my stepdad that it’ll prevent her from reacting out of anger and search for him and escalate the situation then and there, and i hope my aunt can provide some support for myself and her. i’m prepared for her to go through the same processes i went through such as reasoning and denial, but with the evidence there’s no possible way she can deny it. i’m preparing myself for the worst. i just hope that i can be strong for her and support her as this all hits her like it did me. 

i will not be returning home or facing him today. my boyfriend will be on standby to pick up my brothers if needed since my aunt has offered for them to stay with us so my mom can talk to my stepdad without them there. i’ll ask my mom to meet me and of course, not tell my stepdad about the circumstances. maybe she can tell him she’s going to the grocery store. i don’t want him getting any hints that she could be meeting
with me. 

i know i’ve said it a lot but i truly do appreciate the support system i have not only with my family but here too. this has been a nightmare but hearing everyone’s stories about this, proving it’s way too common, is what is helping me get through this and pushing me to do the right thing. not only am i a victim in this but my boyfriend as well and god knows who else. the confrontation won’t happen for about another 7 hours so i’m the meantime i’ll be reading over comments and preparing myself for what comes today. thank you guys.","Original Post:

Title: I (21F) found a spy camera in my room after my step dad (36M) put a surveillance camera in my window
Body: My stepdad (36M) installed a surveillance camera positioned outside of my window to scan our backyard while him and my mother and two younger brothers go camping. I couldn’t go on the trip since i had work, so i was staying home to house sit and feed our animals. My stepdad recently put up new cameras outside so I didn’t see anything wrong with him positioning one outside my window. Come to find out the very next day, I had my boyfriend stay over and he found that the surveillance camera that was ran from outside my window and into my room was being powered by one of those spy camera power blocks. 

For context, my relationship with my stepdad hasn’t always been the best and we tend to butt heads a lot. He’s said a lot of questionable things in the past that i’ve written off because he’s my dad and i would never think he intended to be inappropriate or harmful. He’s been in my life since i was 8 years old. Of course I’m second guessing everything now that i’ve found this camera. It was positioned to point directly at my bedroom door from the far wall, so it has direct view of my entire room, which i change in. 

I tried desperately to rationalize it and think it was maybe a mistake, like he grabbed the wrong charger box. Or maybe he was just trying to look for intruders. But really there is no excuse for putting a camera in MY bedroom. the camera even had an SD card in it. I’m beyond devastated. My stepdad even suggested i invite my boyfriend over to while they’re gone so i have someone here, which is something he would never do considering he’s made it clear before he doesn’t want him over when no one is home because he doesn’t want us ‘fucking in his home’. My boyfriend and I are going to go through the SD card to see if there is anything on it.

I’m at a complete loss at how to even bring this up to my mom. I confided in my aunt and uncle since they live close by and they have been very supportive of me having a conversation with my mom about it. This whole situation is extremely upsetting, I at least have some family to support me as i navigate this but i don’t even know how to bring this up to my mom. This is obviously going to change everything. She had my five year old half brother with him. 

My mind is racing with the consequences this is going to have on our family. Has anyone that has been in a similar situation have advice? How can i do this without causing extreme damage to the family (although that may be impossible). Thank you in advance.

TLDR; i found a hidden camera that my stepdad put in my room, how do i bring this up to my mom?

UPDATE(1/?):

I don’t want to make a whole new thread since i want to make a new update when my parents get back monday, but i want to thank everyone for all the advice. i went to the police station tonight and filed a police report and turned in the spy camera with the SD card. The officer said this is a serious offense and i will likely get a call early next week from an investigator due to the severity of the situation. I’m planning on telling my mother about the police report after we have a conversation about this on monday, with my aunt and uncle present.

When I (18F) was with my ex (19M) a year ago we decided to have sex, which I hadn't done before, but he had. The first time was nice, even though it hurt for me, but the second time we did was awful. I was looking forward to doing it again because I thought it wouldn't hurt the second time, but it did. It hurt much, much worse than the first time so he kept switching positions trying to find one that was ok for me. After a while it became clear that wouldn't happen and my clit and the whole area became sore. So I asked him if we couldn't do it another time and he said ""no, you promised we would do it today, let's try something else"". This went back and forth and I told him I was sore. Then, because he insisted we continue, I half-heartedly said I would give him a blowjob, which I didn't really want to and I thought he would refuse (kind of like when you offer to borrow someone money but make it clear you'd rather not and it's like a last resort offer). He then pulled out and I rolled over to my side but then he looks at me and said ""go on now"". I asked ""what?"" and he said ""well, you said you would blow me, go on now"". So I did it, because I had indeed said I would. And besides, I could have just gotten up or bluntly said no and he would have accepted it, I just suck at boundaries. 

Anyway, if I were to read the post above I'd say it's obviously SA but it didn't feel that way for me. I'm not traumatized or affected by it in any way and I don't see myself as a victim. I just want to know if this was just a bad experience or not. I should also mention I'm writing this post because I'm now in a good relationship and my boyfriend strongly contrasts this asshole but I'm sometimes reminded of him and I get grossed out.

Tl; dr: Had sex for the second time in my life, was in pain and offered to give my bf a bj so he would agree to stop","Original Post:

I would gather evidence, as already stated. My concern is how long has he been doing this and how many people are affected. 

Trust your gut.

Content: i’m very concerned about this as well. i have two brothers who are minors and he’s been in my life for over 14 years now so who’s to say he hasn’t recorded me before or even them. or even distributed it. it’s so terribly devastating to come to terms with him being this evil. he even installed these cameras while i was asleep so there’s no doubt he was hoping i wouldn’t notice.

He deserves prison time.,1,1623648585,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/nzamuq/was_i_actually_raped_or_was_he_just_rough/h1p9dge/,False,"Was I actually raped, or was he just ‘rough’?",pprobablyneedtherapy,"I’m so sorry in advance that this is so scarily long. 

I haven’t really thought about it until this constant feeling of anger that I’ve been having the whole of today. Anger about everything. Especially anger about how reporting my sexual assault and trying to seek medical help for it has been so difficult (dismissing my assault to “it’s not rape / it’s consensual sex and this was just ‘roughness’ / closed your case since no offences were committed; being turned away from the GP and the A&amp;E that the GP referred me to; then being forced to pay nearly $600 for a forensic exam that I did not ask for, that would otherwise be free for sexual assault victims with a ‘police form’ which had not been given to me, a victim of penetrative sexual assault, because a male sexual crimes officer concluded that my experience was 100% consensual sex with a case of “roughness”)   — re-traumatising is putting it lightly. 

I actually started thinking it over and over (mainly because they were intrusive thoughts and i would get stuck in them, and here i am again) and trying to comprehend something so traumatic to me was seen as just “roughness” to the sexual crimes investigating officer who handled my case. They had to tell me, “this isn’t rape”. And I’ve been crying in bed figuring out how my situation was not rape, or even not considered sexual assault. 

Basically I’ve been meeting up with complete strangers for sex because I wanted to hurt myself. Dealing with an intense fear of when I get raped, complete hopelessness over my safety in this world, intense and uncharacteristic hypersexuality (with very dark and disturbing themes), and using sex as self-injury to cheapen myself further because I feel like I deserve it. I mean, just give the men what they’ve consistently shown me that they wanted, right? 

I met this 48 year old man (I’m 23) from online (hookup site). He did not give me good vibes over text because he was very demanding about my attention, and needing to give him immediate replies. People like this give me bad feelings, and he wanted to meet the next day, and I said okay. He booked a day hotel. I had second thoughts that same night but ignored it. We had discussed that even if he was rough, he would be respectful if I needed to stop, and I thought I could trust him. I told him I would show up with a present for him underneath my work clothes, and I had dressed up for him. I showed up at the hotel, realised he brought some BDSM stuff (we did not discuss this — we only discussed sex) and was basically like, well ok he’s a Dom. 

He wanted to go straight to anal and I said okay. I don’t remember if my hands were tied / chained together. He got me to lie down in missionary on the edge of the very bed, and he put himself inside of me while standing up, holding onto my legs with my feet near by his shoulders. Initially it was painful while inserting because he was huge and my tiny hole is 100% not. But it subsided and it started off okay. Then he started slamming it really deep and it was beginning to hurt a lot. He was hitting some kind of wall, all the way inside of my rectum (he was above 15cm I believe, might’ve been 17–20cm — I am still unsure of what he was hitting against), because he was going nearly balls deep. 

I started to use my hands to push his hips and legs away, at first to pace and then to actually push him away. I wanted to tell him to stop but I couldn’t get the words out for some reason. I started crying and he saw me tearing up and looking scared as shit (my face wasn’t one of contentment or release, it was anguish and fear). He stopped, asked me why I was crying. I told him that I was in a lot of pain / it was really painful. And he said, “cry harder”, readjusted my hips and held onto my legs again, and went even deeper and rougher and faster. He did it knowing that I was really in pain and already in tears and pushing against his hips and thighs because of it, and that he would cause me even more pain by doing so, and still did it anyway because he wanted to see me cry even more. My body was twitching out of pain. My crying became [silent screaming and then wailing out loud](https://youtu.be/gS12lKPbjNI). The kind where you’re experiencing extreme distress and terror that you want to pull all of your hair out while hyperventilating — if y’all know what i’m talking about, I can’t find anything on YT that resembles that kind of wide-eyed silent-scream-crying? In my head I could see myself getting dressed and walking out of the door, yet I couldn’t move or do anything or say anything other than wail and hyperventilate and cry as everything hurt. 

When he finally stopped I was glad it was over. Again I wanted to leave as soon as he was out of me, but I couldn’t. I felt like he was owed the 3 hours that I’d told him I was free for, and I was scared to leave. I was worried that he was going to get violent if I tried. I ended up doing everything else that he wanted me to do, for 2 hours — I feel awful that I let myself believe I wanted this, it didn’t feel like full consent, but more of, I had no choice and that meant I’d just have to do it. I guess I could say I consented… the horribly painful vaginal sex, the unprotected blowjob where he would push my head down until he was at the back of my throat, having to ride him vaginally and anally (both quite painful, but not to the extent of involuntary body spasms). He would hit me (without asking) with the leather of his belt, on my breasts and butt, my back, my vagina, my stomach. He slapped me in the face. Hog-tied me so I couldn’t move. Said he would rape me / rape my holes. That he owned them and he owned me. He kept telling me to say “thank you master”. Kept saying things like “I know you want this white fat cock to rape your ass, yeah”, and referring to me as a Chinese whore / slut. He said he would send me to his friends for me to service them. He put a collar on me with a leash. 

I repeatedly said I needed to stop and take a break and he didn’t listen. He just did more stuff to me. Continued doing it non-stop, in different positions, different tools. 

The second time he intentionally caused me pain again was unprotected anal sex (he wanted to come in my ass), this time at the corner edge of the bed in a doggy position where he was standing up behind me. He just thrusted himself in all the way again quite quickly, and I basically audibly yelped / yowled, and my body crumpled. I started crying yet again. This time I was quite spaced out and my brain felt like cotton. He would ask questions and I wouldn’t be able to speak. Then from behind he suddenly grabbed me roughly by the front of the neck and used my throat to pull me up to him, which made his thrusting hurt even more. My body was twitching by itself again every single time he hit the “wall”. I felt nauseous. Holding onto my neck he told me to look at him (over my right shoulder), but i was in so much pain that i keeled over and got my elbows onto the bed. This time he put his knuckles into the fitting collar around my neck, pulled it taut, pressed his knuckles against my throat too, basically choking me, and pulled me up again. I felt lightheaded quite quickly and everything went slow and my hearing kind of went a bit distant while I was gasping for air. 

He told me to look at him again, and I couldn’t, and he jostled the collar and repeated his demand. I turned to look over at him. He told me to smile for him. I couldn’t smile. I couldn’t feel my face at all. Pretty sure my face was trembling from crying and wincing. He demanded it again and I tried and it felt so weird. It was such a wobbly smile. He told me to smile wider. I did it wider, until he was happy and let go of me and I went back onto my elbows again. He was asking me questions / making statements again and I just kept shaking my head to say no to everything. But I didn’t know what he was asking, I don’t really remember. He continued to thrust and then leaned over me and went really deep, and eventually pressed / pinned my entire body down (I went from being on all 4’s to lying flat with my stomach down) and came not long after that. 

I told him after that I couldn’t do it anymore. I needed a break at least. I was exhausted. He said okay, then kept stimulating what he thought was my clit (re: my fucking urethra) very roughly and kept telling me to come. I honestly faked maybe half of it, repeated that I needed a break and was really exhausted, and he would go for one more. This was maybe 8–10 times and he only finally stopped after that because I had to leave soon. 

I went home that evening feeling extremely physically and emotionally raw. I hated the feeling of his semen inside of me. Every time I had a bowel movement my anus seriously hurt (I ended up having a laceration). Every time I peed my vagina would hurt (raw skin on the posterior fourchette). Both were bleeding. I cried for hours that night. He texted me that he wanted to meet me again the next day. I told him I needed a break because I was feeling raw. He said “oh I didn’t realise you were actually in pain”, and I said “that’s why I was crying, I told you it was really painful”, and he said, “I have a crying kink”. Then he went on about how I should have been more assertive if I didn’t feel comfortable. He would have stopped. He was an extremely empathetic person. Had a lot of empathy. Said that there was a fine line between what’s comfortable and what’s unacceptable and that only I would know where that line is for myself. Basically very gaslighty. 

I was extremely depressed the next day. I had a really bad nightmare that same night (Thursday night / Friday morning) too, the worst one I ever had, full of death, suicide, gore, inescapable terror, and rape. I slept through work. Realised I also suffered a neck sprain or strain on the side that he made me turn to look at him. I ate. Cried. Didn’t talk to my family at all. Hid in my room. Slept through the afternoon. Did some work in the evening. Cried. Cried. Cried. Showered and cried. Went back to bed and cried. I blocked his number on Saturday. He contacted me on that hookup site and said “so mean of you to block me”, and that’s the last I’ve communicated with him. 

I feel very largely responsible for putting myself in this situation, knowing that this exact thing was going to be a risk. I mean, all of these meet-ups and being used by men were my way of controlling how I would feel when I eventually got raped, almost like each time I met a person it would be a ‘rehearsal’ for it. And I never once during the whole thing explicitly said “stop” or “no” or literally push him off me or kick him off, mainly because I’m very conflict-averse and if there’s a chance that he would get upset and hit me, which I think everyone would do to me, I wouldn’t physically do anything. I don’t know why I didn’t just get up and leave as soon as I had the chance. I don’t know why I stayed. I don’t know why I laid in bed with him after everything, just resting because I was exhausted. I even laughed at some things he said. 

I don’t know why I tried to convince myself that he was a good person, that because he asked me about my self-harm scars and said he liked me as a person and thought I was attractive (as a slightly chubby person) and a good fuck, that he wasn’t a monster. Even when he was trying to say all of the bullshit about needing to be assertive and all, I said, “yeah I know, it’s not your fault. I wasn’t communicating so you wouldn’t have known”. I can’t believe I said that. I’m so angry with myself, mad at everything I did, and also at everything else that I didn’t do. 

The main parts that I felt were a horrible violation, to me, were the moments where he was actively causing me pain and he knew I was crying and was struggling against him, and still did it anyway, at times by force. But I also can’t help but feel like I didn’t struggle enough, because maybe I should have. I feel like I just let this happen.

So I don’t know. This was what I told the officer inclusive of the pushing, crying, and that he intentionally caused me more pain and was choking me. But was this rape? Was this some kind of assault? Or was this really, truly just a case of ‘roughness’? 

I’ve honestly been getting very disheartened by having this experience be downplayed by the people that are supposed to help me feel safe, especially when they say it’s 100% consensual and just the man being rough. I feel ashamed for even having reported it, because it feels like I’m wasting their time over a not-assault. I feel like my reality of what happened and what I felt in the moment, isn’t real. Like if the people who are supposed to handle sexual assault cases don’t believe that there was anything remotely wrong with what he did, then what gives me the right to feel like something was forced onto (into) me? How do I trust my own judgment over what I felt in my own body, over someone else who supposedly knows better since they handle cases like these? I really don’t understand and I’m desperate to make it make sense…","Original Post:

For context, my relationship with my stepdad hasn’t always been the best and we tend to butt heads a lot. He’s said a lot of questionable things in the past that i’ve written off because he’s my dad and i would never think he intended to be inappropriate or harmful. He’s been in my life since i was 8 years old. Of course I’m second guessing everything now that i’ve found this camera. It was positioned to point directly at my bedroom door from the far wall, so it has direct view of my entire room, which i change in. 

I tried desperately to rationalize it and think it was maybe a mistake, like he grabbed the wrong charger box. Or maybe he was just trying to look for intruders. But really there is no excuse for putting a camera in MY bedroom. the camera even had an SD card in it. I’m beyond devastated. My stepdad even suggested i invite my boyfriend over to while they’re gone so i have someone here, which is something he would never do considering he’s made it clear before he doesn’t want him over when no one is home because he doesn’t want us ‘fucking in his home’. My boyfriend and I are going to go through the SD card to see if there is anything on it.

I’m at a complete loss at how to even bring this up to my mom. I confided in my aunt and uncle since they live close by and they have been very supportive of me having a conversation with my mom about it. This whole situation is extremely upsetting, I at least have some family to support me as i navigate this but i don’t even know how to bring this up to my mom. This is obviously going to change everything. She had my five year old half brother with him. 

My mind is racing with the consequences this is going to have on our family. Has anyone that has been in a similar situation have advice? How can i do this without causing extreme damage to the family (although that may be impossible). Thank you in advance.

TLDR; i found a hidden camera that my stepdad put in my room, how do i bring this up to my mom?

UPDATE(1/?):

I don’t want to make a whole new thread since i want to make a new update when my parents get back monday, but i want to thank everyone for all the advice. i went to the police station tonight and filed a police report and turned in the spy camera with the SD card. The officer said this is a serious offense and i will likely get a call early next week from an investigator due to the severity of the situation. I’m planning on telling my mother about the police report after we have a conversation about this on monday, with my aunt and uncle present. 

As for people messaging me about my profile: thank you for reminding me to delete personal information. Please please do not dox or try to seek any sort of justice for me as this may affect my case. Respect my privacy during this time please as it may be crucial during this investigation.

This was the hardest thing i ever had to do, but whatever this shit was, it’s ending with me. I hope i can get justice for myself and any other victims who may have been violated by him since this will be heavily investigated and the officer said it will likely be looked into further (such as search warrants and looking for more SD cards). i’m hanging on by a thread but the support i have is what’s keeping me together. i’m staying with my boyfriend tonight to keep out of the house. Thanks again for all the love and supportive messages. I’ll update again soon.

UPDATE (2/?)

it’s the next morning and once my boyfriend wakes up we’re going back to my house today to look for any more secret cameras (either in the bathroom or my brothers rooms) so i can submit it for more evidence. i’m iffy about searching my parents room for more evidence as it’s likely he has a hidden camera in there to see me do it. still on the fence about having a police officer search the house, if i do i’ll be sure to update after i’m finished and in a safe place. my aunt has offered to come with me to help me search.

again, thank you everyone for the support. i’m trying as best i can to do this the right way and get as much done with the time i have left. i’m mentally and emotionally drained but i’ll be seeking resources once all of this is said and done. i’m reading everyone’s comments so i’m taking all the advice i can get.

UPDATE (3/?)

i probably won’t be able to update for a few days since today is the day that i talk to my mom, but i just wanted to share the plan i made and hopes for what happens today.

after talking with my aunt, uncle, boyfriend, and my cousin who is a civil lawyer, i’ve decided that i will speak to my mom in a separate location from my stepdad. most likely i’ll have her meet me somewhere outside of our home. i’ll have my aunt with me and this is where i’ll explain everything to her: the camera, past uncomfortable experiences i’ve had with my stepdad that i originally brushed off because he was my dad, video footage of him deliberately setting it up and angling it, and footage of me in my room. im praying she understands why i had to go to my aunt instead of her considering she was not in town and i was worried for her safety if i told her what happened. (she was stuck with him and my brothers about 4 hours away for the weekend) 

i’m hoping with my aunt there and her being away from my stepdad that it’ll prevent her from reacting out of anger and search for him and escalate the situation then and there, and i hope my aunt can provide some support for myself and her. i’m prepared for her to go through the same processes i went through such as reasoning and denial, but with the evidence there’s no possible way she can deny it. i’m preparing myself for the worst. i just hope that i can be strong for her and support her as this all hits her like it did me. 

i will not be returning home or facing him today. my boyfriend will be on standby to pick up my brothers if needed since my aunt has offered for them to stay with us so my mom can talk to my stepdad without them there. i’ll ask my mom to meet me and of course, not tell my stepdad about the circumstances. maybe she can tell him she’s going to the grocery store. i don’t want him getting any hints that she could be meeting
with me. 

i know i’ve said it a lot but i truly do appreciate the support system i have not only with my family but here too. this has been a nightmare but hearing everyone’s stories about this, proving it’s way too common, is what is helping me get through this and pushing me to do the right thing. not only am i a victim in this but my boyfriend as well and god knows who else. the confrontation won’t happen for about another 7 hours so i’m the meantime i’ll be reading over comments and preparing myself for what comes today. thank you guys.","Original Post:

I'm a 20 year old male, now at university. This happened when I was 17.

I was never socially active as a teenager though I played sports and stuff, and a friend invited me to a house party. I didn't drink alot of alcohol or take any drugs, but when I was upstairs in the bathroom a girl started flirting with me. She was attractive and I vaguely knew her so I responded and we left to go in the garden. She was slightly drunk but I'm not sure.

Bear in mind I even then was well over 6 feet tall and 240 pounds, I do boxing and weight lifting, whereas she was about a foot smaller than me and half my size. We started kissing (which I hadn't done before) and she started touching my crotch. I wasn't comfortable with this and I asked her to stop. She laughed and didn't, so I moved her hand away lightly. She then shouted out that I ""touched her"".

I apologised, seeing as we were in the bushes at the top of the garden (about 100 yards long) and I didn't want a scene. It's sort of a blur now, but she basically said that if I didn't ""stop being a baby"" she'd tell everyone at the party I assaulted her.

The only way I can describe what happened next is when you get caught with a good shot in a spar and you're awake but ""in third person"". I know she pulled my trousers and pants down and started riding me, and I must have ejaculated at some point as I found I was sticky later. I had dried mud all over my butt as well.

She left and I just sat there for a while, then went home (not far to walk) in a daze. I remember running a shower and scrubbing the dirt off like a madman, and I went to sleep after.

I didn't report it or anything and for the next few months I didn't speak to her or see her again. I moved out of the area for university and haven't been back since.

But I'm just wondering now, is this a sexual assault? I must have been erect throughout it but I was a virgin and I definitely didn't consent to it, I was afraid of her saying I raped her or something horrible like that.

I plan to get therapy as this has given me a phobia of intimacy and I still haven't been in a relationship to this day","Original Post:

Even if you feel like it doesn’t affect you as much as you believe therapy warrants, it most likely affects you way more than your brain is letting you in on in order to protect you. Please go to a therapist, and it might be helpful to seek out one who specializes in male sexual assault. I hope everything gets better.

Content: It's considered sexual assault as you were asleep and did not consent to him inserting his fingers.

Likely most guys would tell you that you're making a big deal out of it so it's suited to keep your mouth shut when around guys unless you want to be blamed (being drunk, sleeping around a guy, you didn't tell him no when you woke up so you consented) and shamed (if you weren't hanging around sluts you wouldn't be treated like one). 

It's suited to seek free hotline advice or counseling.

Content: I was diagnosed with PTSD a few years ago, and saw a therapist several times a week to deal with that and some other issues, although this particular incident was not brought up in therapy as there was a lot of other stuff going on that was at the forefront of my mind. Currently, I don't feel like I would even still fit the criteria for PTSD. I feel like my case was very mild in comparison to what many people experience, but I am aware of the symptoms and the likelihood that I could regress. 

I currently cannot afford to see a therapist outside of the ones at my school. I am in the process of looking into that, but we only get a certain amount of sessions per year, so we will see how that goes.

Content: What is mild in comparison: Your case of PTSD or your case of sexual assault? If the latter it's suited not to minimize your assault by comparing it to others. 

Perhaps you can contact a hotline for free therapy or support group counseling? Hope all goes well with your potential therapy.

When I was around my prepubescent years and teen years (9-14), I had this maiden around my household. Long story short, she often touched/stroked and pinched my *** probably because she thought I was cute or was being playful, even though it was nothing done with sexual intention. I was young and didn’t have any idea of anything sexual things related, so I never thought anything was wrong with it till I was a teenager. I don’t know if she even knew any better or if she thought it was ok just because that wasn’t her intent, but I’m just curious. Regardless, she did it with full her full consciousness as an adult when I was younger and kept doing it even after I became a teen.

Title: Was this sexual assault?
Body: Does it count as sexual assault?

When I was around my prepubescent years and teen years (9-14), I had this maiden around my household. Long story short, she often touched/stroked and pinched my *** probably because she thought I was cute or was being playful, even though it was nothing done with sexual intention. I was young and didn’t have any idea of anything sexual things related, so I never thought anything was wrong with it till I was a teenager. I don’t know if she even knew any better or if she thought it was ok just because that wasn’t her intent, but I’m just curious. Regardless, she did it with full her full consciousness as an adult when I was younger and kept doing it even after I became a teen.

Content: Yes this is Sexual assault. And she will face charges for this if put in front of a judge.

Also thisnis important: it is not yours ( a child's ) responsibility to say no to being touched there by an adult. It's the adults responsibility to not touch you there no matter the circumstance.
She is disgusting and wrong for this. You are not.

I couldn’t go on the trip since i had work, so i was staying home to house sit and feed our animals. My stepdad recently put up new cameras outside so I didn’t see anything wrong with him positioning one outside my window. Come to find out the very next day, I had my boyfriend stay over and he found that the surveillance camera that was ran from outside my window and into my room was being powered by one of those spy camera power blocks. 

For context, my relationship with my stepdad hasn’t always been the best and we tend to butt heads a lot. He’s said a lot of questionable things in the past that i’ve written off because he’s my dad and i would never think he intended to be inappropriate or harmful. He’s been in my life since i was 8 years old. Of course I’m second guessing everything now that i’ve found this camera. It was positioned to point directly at my bedroom door from the far wall, so it has direct view of my entire room, which i change in. 

I tried desperately to rationalize it and think it was maybe a mistake, like he grabbed the wrong charger box. Or maybe he was just trying to look for intruders. But really there is no excuse for putting a camera in MY bedroom. the camera even had an SD card in it. I’m beyond devastated. My stepdad even suggested i invite my boyfriend over to while they’re gone so i have someone here, which is something he would never do considering he’s made it clear before he doesn’t want him over when no one is home because he doesn’t want us ‘fucking in his home’. My boyfriend and I are going to go through the SD card to see if there is anything on it.

I’m at a complete loss at how to even bring this up to my mom. I confided in my aunt and uncle since they live close by and they have been very supportive of me having a conversation with my mom about it. This whole situation is extremely upsetting, I at least have some family to support me as i navigate this but i don’t even know how to bring this up to my mom. This is obviously going to change everything. She had my five year old half brother with him. 

My mind is racing with the consequences this is going to have on our family. Has anyone that has been in a similar situation have advice? How can i do this without causing extreme damage to the family (although that may be impossible). Thank you in advance.

TLDR; i found a hidden camera that my stepdad put in my room, how do i bring this up to my mom?

UPDATE(1/?):

I don’t want to make a whole new thread since i want to make a new update when my parents get back monday, but i want to thank everyone for all the advice. i went to the police station tonight and filed a police report and turned in the spy camera with the SD card. The officer said this is a serious offense and i will likely get a call early next week from an investigator due to the severity of the situation. I’m planning on telling my mother about the police report after we have a conversation about this on monday, with my aunt and uncle present. 

As for people messaging me about my profile: thank you for reminding me to delete personal information. Please please do not dox or try to seek any sort of justice for me as this may affect my case. Respect my privacy during this time please as it may be crucial during this investigation.

This was the hardest thing i ever had to do, but whatever this shit was, it’s ending with me. I hope i can get justice for myself and any other victims who may have been violated by him since this will be heavily investigated and the officer said it will likely be looked into further (such as search warrants and looking for more SD cards). i’m hanging on by a thread but the support i have is what’s keeping me together. i’m staying with my boyfriend tonight to keep out of the house. Thanks again for all the love and supportive messages. I’ll update again soon.

UPDATE (2/?)

it’s the next morning and once my boyfriend wakes up we’re going back to my house today to look for any more secret cameras (either in the bathroom or my brothers rooms) so i can submit it for more evidence. i’m iffy about searching my parents room for more evidence as it’s likely he has a hidden camera in there to see me do it. still on the fence about having a police officer search the house, if i do i’ll be sure to update after i’m finished and in a safe place. my aunt has offered to come with me to help me search.

again, thank you everyone for the support. i’m trying as best i can to do this the right way and get as much done with the time i have left. i’m mentally and emotionally drained but i’ll be seeking resources once all of this is said and done. i’m reading everyone’s comments so i’m taking all the advice i can get.

UPDATE (3/?)

i probably won’t be able to update for a few days since today is the day that i talk to my mom, but i just wanted to share the plan i made and hopes for what happens today.

after talking with my aunt, uncle, boyfriend, and my cousin who is a civil lawyer, i’ve decided that i will speak to my mom in a separate location from my stepdad. most likely i’ll have her meet me somewhere outside of our home. i’ll have my aunt with me and this is where i’ll explain everything to her: the camera, past uncomfortable experiences i’ve had with my stepdad that i originally brushed off because he was my dad, video footage of him deliberately setting it up and angling it, and footage of me in my room. im praying she understands why i had to go to my aunt instead of her considering she was not in town and i was worried for her safety if i told her what happened. (she was stuck with him and my brothers about 4 hours away for the weekend) 

i’m hoping with my aunt there and her being away from my stepdad that it’ll prevent her from reacting out of anger and search for him and escalate the situation then and there, and i hope my aunt can provide some support for myself and her. i’m prepared for her to go through the same processes i went through such as reasoning and denial, but with the evidence there’s no possible way she can deny it. i’m preparing myself for the worst. i just hope that i can be strong for her and support her as this all hits her like it did me. 

i will not be returning home or facing him today. my boyfriend will be on standby to pick up my brothers if needed since my aunt has offered for them to stay with us so my mom can talk to my stepdad without them there. i’ll ask my mom to meet me and of course, not tell my stepdad about the circumstances. maybe she can tell him she’s going to the grocery store. i don’t want him getting any hints that she could be meeting
with me. 

i know i’ve said it a lot but i truly do appreciate the support system i have not only with my family but here too. this has been a nightmare but hearing everyone’s stories about this, proving it’s way too common, is what is helping me get through this and pushing me to do the right thing. not only am i a victim in this but my boyfriend as well and god knows who else. the confrontation won’t happen for about another 7 hours so i’m the meantime i’ll be reading over comments and preparing myself for what comes today. thank you guys.","Original Post:
