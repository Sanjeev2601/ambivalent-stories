Think about what the other comment is suggesting you do (press charges)? How will that go to the cops? I was with my boyfriend, we went to a party, we both got drunk and I know I lost my virginity but I dont remember.... 🤦🏻\\u200d♀️ There is nothing you can do at this point. Whatever happened, already happened. But what you should do is get rid of that boyfriend of yours and heal. Take the time you need to forgive yourself and learn from the experience. I won\\'t drink 1 alcoholic beverage unless there is a trusted friend of mine with me. I, too, have made major mistakes in life while drunk that I regret. Please dont beat yourself up over this. Find a way to forgive yourself and hit a mental reset. It\\'s never too late to start over. Be easy on yourself. ✨️\\U0001fa77\"\\n\\nWe need to see if it contains:\\n\\nInformation support: giving advice, facts, resources, explanations, or opinionated judgments used to inform/guide. This comment includes advice: \"You should be able to trust your boyfriend... Being drunk is no exception.\" Also \"There is nothing you can do at this point.\" \"What you should do is get rid of that boyfriend...\". That\\'s advice. So Information support = YES.\\n\\nEmotional support: expresses care, empathy, comforting, apologizing, \"I\\'m sorry that you feel the way you do.\" Also \"Please don\\'t beat yourself up...\". That\\'s emotional support. So Emotional support = YES.\\n\\nEsteem support: building user up, complimenting, validating feelings as reasonable/normal. The comment says \"You put yourself in a vulnerable position\" (blame) and \"You should be able to trust your boyfriend\". Not really building up. It does say \"Find a way to forgive yourself... Be easy on yourself.\" That\\'s more self-compassion suggestion, maybe some validation. But does it validate feelings? It says \"I\\'m sorry you feel the way you do.\" That\\'s acknowledging feelings, but esteem support is more about complimenting or validating feelings as reasonable. Could be considered validation of feelings? Might be borderline. However, the comment also says \"you\\'re both in the wrong here\" and \"You put yourself in a vulnerable position\". That\\'s more blame, not esteem. So likely Esteem support = NO.\\n\\nNetwork support: encouraging to reach out to external help systems. The comment suggests \"get rid of that boyfriend\" and \"heal\", \"take time\". Not specifically encouraging therapy, friends, police. It mentions \"How will that go to the cops?\" but that\\'s a question, not suggestion to go. So Network support = NO.\\n\\nTangible assistance: offering personal help directly. The comment does not say \"I can help you\" or \"I\\'m here\". So NO.\\n\\nGroup interactions: any reply that primarily participates socially, sharing own experience, gratitude, etc. This comment includes personal anecdote: \"I was with my boyfriend, we went to a party, we both got drunk and I know I lost my virginity but I dont remember....\". That\\'s sharing own experience. That qualifies as group interaction (sharing own story). Also includes advice. Group interactions can co-occur. So Group interactions = YES.\\n\\nSeeking support: forced NO.\\n\\nNow Not applicable = YES only if all evaluated labels are NO. Since we have some YES, Not applicable = NO.\\n\\nThus final JSON:\\n\\nInformation support: YES\\nEmotional support: YES\\nEsteem support: NO\\nNetwork support: NO\\nTangible assistance:'))\n",

Certainly a 16 year old grooming and sexually touching a 12 year old is a form of molestation, and society is pretty clear that molesting a child (which OP was) is considered rape.  Is it at the limit of what society defines as rape?  Yes, probably.\\\\n\\\\nWhat happened to us is awful, and you have my deepest empathy - but I also have empathy for OP, because this kind of molestation can have considerable psychological impacts later in life too.  It can reshape people’s relationship with sex and sexuality, certainly.  Is it as toxic, painful, damaging?  No, but it isn’t a competition.\\\\n\\\\nImagine some alternative universe where you were such an incredibly psychopathic hardass that your experience didn’t shake you, that you were able to look back on it and just say “whatever”, no PTSD, no flashbacks, no effect on your life.  That doesn’t make what happened better.  Now imagine yourself far more sensitive than you are now, but what happened was equally far less bad.  You would feel the same way about it as you do now, but might have to listen to someone tell you it wasn’t a real rape.\\\\n\\\\nDifferent people have different thresholds for psychological effects, that’s diversity and that’s okay.\",\\n \"is_last_comment_by_op\": false\\n}\\n\\nMake sure newline representation is okay.
