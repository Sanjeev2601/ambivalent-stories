It sounds like, even though you initially consented, you were very distressed at the time and felt your boundaries weren’t respected when you asked them to stop. That can truly feel like a violation, and your feelings are completely valid. What happened to you is a real trauma, and you deserve to acknowledge that. It’s okay to see yourself as a survivor, and your experience matters, regardless of how it may differ from other circumstances. Please take gentle care of yourself.\n"
