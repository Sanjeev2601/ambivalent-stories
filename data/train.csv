I went to a party with a group of friends, thinking I knew a lot of people and there was parental supervision so I was in a safe space. This resulted in me drinking way more than I could handle (which is completely my fault, I didn't know my limits and I take the blame for going overboard) and can only remember small parts of the night. A guy I went to school with when I was younger was there, so we spoke and started catching up, however he made it clear he was interested in me romantically, so I told him I had a boyfriend and wasn't interested before leaving him to find my friends. I don't really remember anything else from the night. Two of my friends and I left, and we all stayed the night together at one of their homes. The next morning I woke up with the worst hangover I'd ever had, and was sick all morning. One of my friends told me that last night, she'd seen me making out with the guy I mentioned earlier. I was so shocked, especially because I genuinely had no memory of it, and I was absolutely against cheating. I asked her why she hadn't stopped me and she said that she had tried, but I didn't respond to her when she asked what I was doing. Another friend later told me that he had seen me throughout the night, lying on the ground and unable to walk or speak. 

I told my boyfriend about a month after it happened, because I was so scared of what his reaction would be. He ended up dumping me, saying that I had cheated on him and that I 'clearly just wanted attention from other guys' and all of this really nasty stuff. I explained to him that I had no memory of it, that I didn't like or want the guy who had kissed me, how much of a bad state I was in, and that I was so so sorry, but he said being drunk was just an excuse girls use when they cheat. I'm so upset, because I don't see this as me cheating on him, I see this as me being taken advantage of in a near-unconscious state. He's now gone and told his friends that I cheated on him, which has spread around my school. Is he correct in saying that I'm to blame? I know it's my fault for getting so drunk in such an unsafe environment, but can he really call what happened 'cheating'?

Content: It's not your shame to live through. Your abuser refuses to be shamed by their terrible acts, yes, but it doesn't then fall to you to perform emotional and spiritual work on behalf of that person. It's simply not transferable to you, regardless of how it feels.

We are *not* how we've been treated. We are ourselves and you are *yourself*, nothing another person could do to you is capable of corrupting that authenticity. There's an incorruptible purity of youness, whether you feel it or not. This shame is not you, and it's not about you.

Dear friend, I want you to be free from this unnecessary burden. You already carry so much.

Is this sexual assault or rape and what if i actually initiated or said yes to the sex? i don’t know how to feel right now i’m just disgusted by myself and the whole situation. Also to clarify we didn’t have enough alcohol for him to get really drunk so i don’t think he was that drunk, he could definitely tell i was out of it though because i have a video of me talking and i couldn’t even pronounce the words correctly.

He would try to take and spread embarrassing photos of me, consistently poke jokes at me, touch my stuff, and overall disrespect me.


One photo of me he spread was of me looking at my crush's insta profile, and it was badly timed. My eyes were closed and mouth was open, and it looked like I was jerking off. He laughed and said the whole school saw it.

I heard that he even spread rumors about me that I actually was jerking off, and actually convinced people that I was.

One time, i was on my laptop looking at a video called ""how to get a gf"". I minimized it to look at colleges. The kid came up to me, put his fingers on my keyboard, pulled up the video, laughed at me, and told some classmates in the same room what I was watching.

One day, I even felt very sad at one point (not depressed, just sad one morning, probably because I woke up on the wrong side of the bed, not at all related to him), that I looked up suicide on my laptop. The kid took a pic of me doing so and tried to spread it around. He laughed and said a quarter of the grade saw it.

In june, I impersonated him on reddit and made some awful posts insulting some classmates, and sent that impersonation account to 7 people to try to get it to spread.

I got even with him by defaming him online, giving out his first and last name, as well as saying lies about him bullying kids with Downs Syndrome and him being a pedophile and stuff like that. I basically pretended to be him writing those things, and some of those things are popping up in the Google Search if you look up his first and last name. I first did that back in June of 2020, before doing some in October, and finally doing some in December.

I posted a pic of him and pretending to be him, called him by his name, his state, and that he was a pervert.

Also in October, I ruined his reputation by telling everybody how much of a jerk he was to me, and told everyone to stay away from him because of how awful he is.

I had just learned last week that the kid had to go to see a doctor because after I made those posts about him, he lost weight, had trouble sleeping, and lost his appetite.

A lot of people who I talked to about this, including my parents, are telling me that what I have done was far worse than what he has done to me, because I caused him ""permanent damage"", but he did not cause me ""permanent damage"". They said something about how whatever goes on the internet does not fully go away, and that I should feel sorry and move on.

The kid told me to ""stop playing victim"" because I ""have gotten more than revenge"", since I have caused him ""permanent damage"".

Some people on Reddit are even telling me that I went too far.

It's gotten to the point where even my own parents are getting fed up of talking to me about it.

But for some weird reason, I keep ruminating on all the shit he said/did to me, and I can't help but feel very good about myself for all the trauma he is going through.

Sadly, some of the posts I made about him have been removed off of Google Search, but others are still sticking on there.

As a matter of fact, in my own head, I keep thinking that what HE did was worse, and that I should've doxed him even more to even things out with him.

I know it's very opinion-based, but do you side with me or my parents/the jerk/others on Reddit?

Comment (depth 1):
Author: snoogledoogle6
Content: Ok, idk if I mentioned everything.

I had a personal Reddit account on here that he hacked into and made a dirty post on, before showing it to some classmates in the same room as me.

He also had no concern for my wellbeing and even my life.

Could I argue that the number of shitty things he did to me are more than the number of shitty things i did to him?

Content: It doesn’t matter. He was an ass to you and you were an ass back. It doesn’t make you even, it just makes both of you assholes.

Comment (depth 3):

Content: But youre also saying that what ive done to him was worse than what he has done to me.

If the number of his offenses are greater than the number of mine, how is that true?

Comment (depth 4):
Author: [deleted]
Content: Your offenses were worse even if they were less numerous.

But what I’m actually saying is that it doesn’t matter. You shouldn’t be trying to get revenge. If someone has mistreated you then go to an authority figure and get him disciplined. Seek justice.

But since you settled for revenge now you are no different than the bully that bullied you.

Some guy I met briefly at dinner was next to me. He asked if I wanted to cuddle. I said yes. I thought were going to cuddle and go to sleep.

It was dark. We are spooning, and I feel his boner on my butt. I feel his hands moving. I thought he was uncomfortable at first but realized he was feeling me up. After a few mins I hear him whisper me his intentions. He whispered several more times. He keeps roaming his hands. It's hard to communicate because people are sleeping right next to us. Eventually after a few more mins he slips his hand into my panties and starts fingered me.

I was not expecting this in that situation.  People are asleep right right next to us, didn't want to wake them up. I touch his chin at one point as he is fingering me (I don't know why, I guess I just went along with it). Eventually I pull his hand off me. He whispers and asks what's up, I tell him I'm tired. He stops and we go to sleep.

I didn't know this guy's name, we literally just met.  He was a random guy.   I wasn't very attracted to him. I thought were just going to cuddle and sleep. Was this SA?  He did stop when I took his hand off. I also did touch his chin, so maybe he read that a certain way? But this bothers me because it was with basically a stranger and in a room full of people. I didn't flirt with him at all and we just met. It was cold and I thought it we were just going to cuddle and sleep.  I've been bothered by this a while.

Just let me know and I will try to fix it!

&nbsp;

About two years ago, I had sex for the first time with my boyfriend (we have since broken up). I'm a very small person and getting started was really difficult and painful, but I figured that was normal for a virgin and my body type (to give some perspective - I can only use ""light"" absorbency tampons because larger sizes cause me enough going in and out that I would rather change smaller tampons every hour). Anyways, after a while, the sex didn't get any better - it was still painful and generally unenjoyable. I wanted to stop, but I expressed my feelings pretty vaguely to my boyfriend. I think I said something like ""hey, I think I'm done for the night."" (It was a long time ago so I don't exactly remember.) My boyfriend said ""oh, okay"" but kept going. I was a bit confused and kind of shocked/upset when he kept moving, but I didn't really know what to say. In the moment, I thought it was obvious that I meant I didn't want to have sex anymore. In hindsight, I see how it might not have been clear. 

&nbsp;

I brought this up with a friend a while later, after we had broken up. She was shocked and said it was definitely sexual assault. I've never been sure and haven't really thought about it until now - I'm collaborating on an art piece that has to do with sexuality, and I thought of this. Now it's kind of bugging me because I don't know how I define this incident, but at the same time, I feel like it has a place in this particular art piece. I guess I figured a good place to start would be whether this incident could legally be defined as sexual assault. I'm also open to hearing any general opinions, suggestions, interpretations on what happened. Thanks in advance!","Original Post:

now had you said ""stop"" or ""or get off"" or anything that asserted your desire to stop, i'd have (admittedly probably begrudgingly), stopped.

Content: Yeah, in the moment, I thought it was obvious that I wasn't enjoying myself (I was just lying there pretty still trying to handle the pain, didn't say anything other than that + ""ow"" in the beginning). Afterwards, I realized that what I said could probably be interpreted as ""I'm done, I orgasmed"" and I should have said something less ambiguous like ""stop"".
