Just adding that I was raped when I was young, I learned how to fight back and escape. I hope OP does the same for her own safety.

I struggle because during my childhood, a certain elder woman in my family who obviously I lived with(and still do sometimes) often touched me and groped at me in sensitive areas, which I found uncomfortable. There was also kissing, which after a stage I did find uncomfortable, especially on the lips. There was also sometimes a major lack of privacy when I was changing, which also I didn't feel entirely comfortable with.

But recently I was thinking about exactly why I struggle with intimacy and why physical touch is hard for me, and it set off this chain of thought and brought these memories to the fore.

 I don't necessarily think that the intention behind these actions was ever untoward, or beyond simple affection, but it made me very uncomfortable and conscious and affected me subconsciously.

Comment (depth 1):
Author: am707
Content: In our country, child abuse doesn't carry the weight that it may elsewhere. It's considered the norm and usually brushed off, so you learn to live with that. Even most forms of sexual assault aren't really taken seriously. There's no consequences for the abuser for the most part, but I'm struggling with what it means for me and how it's affecting me.

Author: XXXORACLE
Content: Of course, you don’t have to force yourself. If you don’t feel like your circle of friends is supportive, it might be time to meet some new people. Therapists are professionals and know better than to point fingers like that, so i strongly recommend going that path if you feel comfortable. I wish you the best, and I’m genuinely sorry you had to go through such a thing.

Comment (depth 3):
Author: am707
Content: Thank you so much. Therapy is a difficult option right now because of the cost and also because I'm still not independent. I'm waiting to become independent financially so that I can get the help I need. Till then I have to tough it out I suppose.

Comment (depth 4):
Author: XXXORACLE
Content: In my country, there is a free therapy service for teenagers and kids, it was recommended to me by my school nurse. Maybe try looking for something similar, or a therapist covered by your insurance (if you have it)? If your parents ask, try dodging the question smoothly or making up an excuse.

Comment (depth 5):
Author: am707
Content: Our country doesn't have the system of insurance. You just pay the medical bills. It's difficult to go to a proper therapist without my parents' consent( I've tried, didn't go well). Been trying to save up to maybe try some of the online options like 7cups.

I am 18m and currently sitting my year 12 exams. Now I know three people who I believe have sexually assaulted me. 22f who I will call E, 18m who I’ll call L and 17m who I’ll call J.

E: so this is actually my 22 year old sister. So back when I was young (around 5-6) my sister used to take me out to her room (she was about 9-10) and she was force me to kiss her and she would grab my butt. She did this for multiple months over that year. 

J: so I will do J next as he is the quickest. So J and I have known each other for 13 years now roughly, we have basically grown up together. So when I was in year 7, (about 12–13). J walked up behind me in one of my classes and started squeezing my butt. Now I told him to stop which he did for about a week before he did it again. This happened over and over again for the next 2 years. He stopped for 2 years then for the last year and a half, he has been doing stuff like grabbing me from behind, he also acts like he is going to kiss me.J last year, he walked up behind me while I was talking to a teacher about feedback for my assignment and he full force slapped my ass.

L: so L I have known for only 6 years. In year 7, L used to tell me about weird stuff. Then in year 9, he started to grab my butt as well when he walked behind me. He got much worse in year 10 as he started to not only grab my ass but he also stuck his fingers up my ass at one point. I hated it when he did that. Then in year 11, he started to grab me from behind on my shoulders and he used to slam his crotch into my ass. Even when I told him to stop he kept going. He also used to say to me, “I am going to touch you now.” Or “are you ready to be touched tonight.” The scary part is that L knows where I live. L also randomly grabs my thighs during classes and he will caress my inner thighs. I told him so many times to stop grabbing me and he kept doing it. He also grabbed my shorts and my d*ck one during a class lesson. I couldn’t even focus on anything for the rest of that school week. 

This has been hard for me to talk about. My parents don’t believe me when I am honest. They always allow my sisters to share their experiences but not me. I am the only son out of my parents 4 kids. This again is the first time I have ever spoken about this.

Content: Alright. Let me see if framing this with a different crime might help because your therapist was/is right. This is definitely coersion, sexual assault, and rape. Whatever you want to call it, it qualifies as any and all of the above, but clearly that's going to be a hard pill for you to swallow. 

Let's say that your friend wanted to take your TV home with him. You told him you wanted to keep your TV right where it is, but he insists on trying to take the tv. You offer him your computer monitor. You don't want him to take that either, but at least you're a little more comfortable with the idea of him having your computer monitor than taking your whole tv. He rejects this idea and insists on taking the tv and now he keeps trying the door handle, but you've locked it. He decides that doesn't matter. He'll just kick the door down and take the tv anyways. You relent and offer him the tv on the condition that he let's you unlock the door first. That's still theft right? He just robbed you. Same thing goes for sex. If you offered it or you agreed to let him take it when he asked it would be a gift. If he insists on taking it that's theft/rape in this case.

Content: Thank you for this. I really appreciate you taking the time to write that explanation out and it does help so much.  

You are right that it is a hard pill to swallow. Growing up as a woman you hear high rape/assault statistics over and over again, but I always thought ""it could never happen to me."" I think I'm still caught in that.  It never occured to me that I would join those statistics. Thank you again for your comment. I hope you have a wonderful new years 🧡

Content: That's where everybody starts out. The rose colored glasses that make the world seem safe are ever present. Then, one day they crack and the real world becomes much harder to ignore. That sudden jerk from the everyday to what feels like a battlefield or maybe even a horror film/action movie takes a while to catch up with you. It's all so confusing and disorienting. What's safe? What was really a red flag we couldn't see through the rosey tint of the glasses? How do we fit into this new more dangerous world? How do we avoid it happening again? If bad things happen to bad people then am I bad? Or is the world callous and random and these kinds of things are just unavoidable and completely at the mercy of luck? How dangerous is the new world now that we're in it? Is it as dangerous as it seems or am I just on hypervigilance mode all the time now? There's a lot to manage when the realization sticks and not much of it is very fun. Especially when you have a fear response or your body betrays your mind and parts of the assault feel good. All of that just confuses things way worse. The good/bad news is, you're not alone. Many people have gone through this before you, many have gone through it after you, and many more will go through it one day. Each and every last one of those people can help you to sort things out if and when you're comfortable enough to ask a question. I've been around the block enough times myself that I generally have at least some idea how to help or what other's are going through and there's never any judgement on my part. And if you're not comfortable with asking me or taking my advice specifically there's a couple thousand people on here to help you out. It's rough, but you'll make it through to the other side. Have a great week and a fantastic new year.

The whole time he was kissing me, fondling me, taking off my shirt I continuously told him Im 16 and it doesn't seem right. He continued on and said he doesn't care and that I'm ""mature."" He said he was close enough and can sometimes have a ""teenage mindset"" so it's not a big deal. I felt straight violated. I was completely shocked. When I finally leave his apartment he hugs me out the door and looks at me and goes ""we're cool right, you're not going to tell anyone and no one's going to know."" I tell him I won't say anything. Does this count as SA even though we didn't end up having sex. Also it's kind of my fault for going to his place in the first place like what was I expecting? I'm also scared now. We go to the same job and as of right now it's only been a couple days and we haven't seen each other at work yet. Everything is weird now. I don't know if I should report him.

He also has my address since he sent an Uber there to pick me up. It's scary that he would be okay hooking up with a 16 yr old.

He’s 20 and wanting to get with you knowing well that you’re only 16, he’s a predator and he uses all the methods of grooming.

Another friend of mine said rape about the second incident as well and I had a hard time thinking of it that way because it didn't go until ""completion"".",1,1755394895,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ms2e0e/was_this_sa_or_a_misunderstanding/n93uef3/,TRUE,Was this SA or a misunderstanding?,Emotional_Low_3373,"My ex boyfriend crossed sexual boundaries multiple times with me. He interprets both occasions as ""misunderstandings"" and I feel like they fall under the umbrella of SA. 

The first involved me saying no to sex (very clearly - ""I don't want to have sex""), and then pulling away from cuddling & kissing. He then continued to grope me on my boobs and vag (over clothes) and try to make out with me, and when I confronted him about it later his excuse was that he ""wasn't trying to have sex"". He also blamed his behavior on being on mushrooms (mind you, it was a microdose - he wasn't tripping). He also didn't clarify before the groping and kissing that that was all he wanted. He just went right back to kissing/groping a few mins after I had said no. 

The second time, we were fooling around on the floor before leaving for a dinner with a friend. I say ""fooling around"", but really he was groping me relentlessly and I was rolling my eyes but kind of going along with it. It's all a blur, but suddenly he was flipping me over (I had been on my stomach and scrolling on my phone), and my pants were coming off. I did go along with this, but his pants were coming off too and I said in quick succession ""I don't think I'm ready yet"", and ""I'm not there yet"" because I realized he was going straight for penetration with no real foreplay other than groping me on the ass. He then touched me (to see if I was wet - he later used that as one of his excuses - he supposedly thought I meant I wasn't wet enough, which I still think isn't consent because a bodily response isn't consent and I was verbalizing my hesitation), and said ""oh, you ARE there"". And proceeded to try to penetrate me. At this point I was completely frozen because it was happening so fast, and him trying to penetrate me was hurting me. I went into freeze/fawn mode and tried to help him penetrate me, because I thought ""if this is going to happen I at least don't want it to hurt"". This didn't work because clearly my body wasn't ready at all. Later, in the shower, I realized that this part tore my vagina a little bit. He stopped after about 20-30 seconds of half-penetrating me when I was in clear pain and because he couldn't get it all the way in. He then acted like nothing happened and I was in total shock. 

There were a couple other instances where he kissed me after I had said no, and there were times where I wasn't responding to his sexual advances (arms at my side, barely kissing back) but he would keep going and doing the things he knew would turn me on, until I finally responded. He also ""jokingly"" groped me all the time even when I would roll my eyes and back away. He would also pretend to fuck me from behind if I bent down to put shoes on, etc. Just generally disrespectful behavior, imo. 

Talking to him directly about both of these incidents resulted in full meltdowns, with him telling me I ""can't"" leave him because of this, otherwise he wouldn't be able to live with himself anymore. He said ""I can't see myself as the kind of person who would do that"". He kept repeating that he wouldn't want to live with himself anymore if I left him because of this.

Title: Was this SA or a misunderstanding?
Body: My ex boyfriend crossed sexual boundaries multiple times with me. He interprets both occasions as ""misunderstandings"" and I feel like they fall under the umbrella of SA. 

The first involved me saying no to sex (very clearly - ""I don't want to have sex""), and then pulling away from cuddling & kissing. He then continued to grope me on my boobs and vag (over clothes) and try to make out with me, and when I confronted him about it later his excuse was that he ""wasn't trying to have sex"". He also blamed his behavior on being on mushrooms (mind you, it was a microdose - he wasn't tripping). He also didn't clarify before the groping and kissing that that was all he wanted. He just went right back to kissing/groping a few mins after I had said no. 

The second time, we were fooling around on the floor before leaving for a dinner with a friend. I say ""fooling around"", but really he was groping me relentlessly and I was rolling my eyes but kind of going along with it. It's all a blur, but suddenly he was flipping me over (I had been on my stomach and scrolling on my phone), and my pants were coming off. I did go along with this, but his pants were coming off too and I said in quick succession ""I don't think I'm ready yet"", and ""I'm not there yet"" because I realized he was going straight for penetration with no real foreplay other than groping me on the ass. He then touched me (to see if I was wet - he later used that as one of his excuses - he supposedly thought I meant I wasn't wet enough, which I still think isn't consent because a bodily response isn't consent and I was verbalizing my hesitation), and said ""oh, you ARE there"". And proceeded to try to penetrate me. At this point I was completely frozen because it was happening so fast, and him trying to penetrate me was hurting me. I went into freeze/fawn mode and tried to help him penetrate me, because I thought ""if this is going to happen I at least don't want it to hurt"". This didn't work because clearly my body wasn't ready at all. Later, in the shower, I realized that this part tore my vagina a little bit. He stopped after about 20-30 seconds of half-penetrating me when I was in clear pain and because he couldn't get it all the way in. He then acted like nothing happened and I was in total shock. 

There were a couple other instances where he kissed me after I had said no, and there were times where I wasn't responding to his sexual advances (arms at my side, barely kissing back) but he would keep going and doing the things he knew would turn me on, until I finally responded. He also ""jokingly"" groped me all the time even when I would roll my eyes and back away. He would also pretend to fuck me from behind if I bent down to put shoes on, etc. Just generally disrespectful behavior, imo. 

Talking to him directly about both of these incidents resulted in full meltdowns, with him telling me I ""can't"" leave him because of this, otherwise he wouldn't be able to live with himself anymore. He said ""I can't see myself as the kind of person who would do that"". He kept repeating that he wouldn't want to live with himself anymore if I left him because of this. Both times, I froze so much because of his reaction that I had to comfort HIM about it, and minimize what had happened so that he would calm down. He also blamed it on being autistic and not picking up on cues, he mentioned a conversation we had about me wanting him to dom me (but we didn't talk about this right before the second incident, we talked about it WEEKS before and then never had another convo about it). We had also had a talk where I said he needed to stop trying to penetrate me so quickly because it led to pain, but he conveniently forgot about that conversation.

Is there something wrong with me?

Around ten years ago, I (now 32F) was in a relationship with a man 16 years older than me.

I remember that I really liked him for a long time before we started dating. He wasn't keen on the idea at all because of the age gap, but after a few years of being friends, we eventually started dating.

I was delighted to be in a relationship with him. I had wanted it for so long. We were both Christians, so having sex was completely off the table, but it didn't stop us from doing other things.

One night, he was staying at my house. He was going to sleep in my room, and I was going to sleep in my sisters room with her.

I remember I snuck back into my room to see him. We fooled around a bit, and I fell asleep. 

I woke up a few hours later, and he was awake. That's when he told me that he had tried putting a finger in me when I was sleeping.

It didn't bother me at the time, it just left me feeling a bit odd because he was telling me he did this and I had no recollection. At the time, I was more curious than anything due my complete inexperience with men. 

Anyway, long story short, we split up maybe a year later. He became quite obsessive, and it took years for him to leave me alone.

I got married to another man, who I love dearly and who I now have a family with, and my ex even showed up at the wedding.

The thing is, until recently, I didn't think about this incident at all. That was until my husband told me about a guy at his work who was charged for doing the exact same thing to a girl while she slept.

I didn't associate it with being wrong, and now I'm feeling really weird(?) It's the only word I can use to describe it.

I feel kind of grossed out, but not that upset. Kind of because I don't actually remember it happening. But that makes me feel like there's something deeply wrong with me. 

I told my best friend, who knows my ex, and she said it was sexual assault. I built up the courage to tell my husband, and he said the same.

If I was sexually assaulted, surely I'd feel...more???

Am I messed up in the head? 

I just watched a TV series where SA and the aftermath was a major theme, and now I can't stop thinking about this.

Can anyone give me advice? Help me make sense of this? Was I sexually assaulted? Is it too late to be mulling this over?

I'm scared that me thinking about this now is going to cause deep rooted issues.

Or maybe these feelings have been rooted since it happened and I'm just starting to feel them

I was 12 years old and my older sister who was 16 at the time had a friend (let’s call her Rose) over to spend the night. The three of us went swimming in our pool and Rose was very touchy the whole time. Nothing overtly sexual, but definitely flirty. After this we went inside and watched a scary movie.

Content: As someone who was actually raped aka a man forcefully put his penis in me when I was 6, if you go to court and say “I didn’t try to stop  it because it was a hot high school chick”, you both were minors a sophomore in high school is what 15 16? She’s not an adult and they won’t try her as one. That’s only four years older that isn’t much. It’s normal for high schoolers to date middle schoolers even now a days. Rape is when someone has sex with you against your will, sounds like you were just chilling letting the high school chick touch you’re dick, just because you were 12 doesn’t mean it was rape.

Content: Just because his experience of sexual assault doesn’t match yours doesn’t make it invalid.  Recognising his assault doesn’t lessen the severity of yours.  The courts are unlikely to find his assailant guilty of a crime, however if a conviction were required before we could class something as an assault, then there would only be somewhere under 2,000 rapes a year in the US.  We know from the report numbers there are more like 50 times more than that reported, and reported rapes are just the tip of the iceberg.

Supporting other victims of less directly traumatic assaults doesn’t make your victimisation seem less serious, but more.

Content: Not invalidating his, simply stating that it sounds like bullshit. Don’t act like you don’t know good and well everyone these days is trying to say they were raped for attention since everyone else seems to have been actually raped. I had a bunch of dudes try to touch me when I was younger was that rape no it’s not. People know when they’ve been raped it’s fucking traumatic.

Content: That may be your experience, but many young children don’t feel violated by their decades-older molesters until they later realise how much damage was done psychologically, how far from normal their perceptions had become.  It doesn’t *have* to feel violating at the time for it to be rape.  Discounting rapes that involve grooming of children by pedophiles is a backwards leap IMO.  Given the ages OP mentioned, certainly it was an offence of a lesser degree than some, and many rapes are worse, more violating, more harmful emotionally and physically than others.  Still, they were molested nonetheless.

1c8kn7f,,sexualassault,l0h2n6f,t3_1c8kn7f,0,[deleted],"YES this is SA. It’s a red flag from the start that he wanted to smoke with a 16 year old, tf? I’m 21 and when my flatmates 16 y o sister came to stay at our flat for the weekend, I viewed her as a kid (bc she is one)- we cooked her dinner, and tried to show her the city. We didn’t drink or smoke with her bc we’re adults and she’s a kid! We felt a sense of parental duty to her! 

Not only this, but this man seems like he had sex in mind from the start, which is why he gave you weed, I guess to make you a bit ‘looser’ and in the mood. 

All of these red flags aside, he deliberately ignored your explicit verbal consent, multiple times. I am so sorry this happened to you. 

Personally I think that yes, you should report him. He gave drugs to a 16 y o and sexually assaulted you. If you don’t want to go down the reporting route which I agree can be scary and uncomfortable, I would recommend trying to access support for yourself.

Story time.... I (16f) was texting with a (20m)that I knew from work. He invited me over to smoke and I agreed. Looking back I realized that he must've taken some of our chat sexual even though I had no intentions of being sexual. The ""sexual"" comments I'm talking about would be how I said I would shower and get ready and I take it he must of thought I was freshening up and getting prepared for sex. If I had known he wanted to hook up I definitely wouldn't have gone but me being stupid and naive I thought we were gonna have a chill smoke sesh and that's it yk. So anyway he pays for my Uber over to his apartment and takes me to his room. At this point we're talking and chilling smoking nic while he rolls and prepares the blunt. It's ready so we start smoking and he goes ""do you know how to do a ghost?"" I answered no and he's like ""come over let me show you."" After he says that I go from sitting on a chair across him to sitting right next to him in his bed. Right when I got next to him he starts touching all over me sexually. I start getting nervous and uncomfortable. I try to push myself away from him but he pulls me in and continues on with sexual touch. I said ""I don't think I can do this"" and instead of stopping he pulls me closer and kisses me. That's when I got really uncomfortable and told him I'm not ready for this. He says ""please it'll be alright"" ""c'mon you just look so good."" I tell him I don't think I can do this and still he doesn't stop. He starts taking off my shirt and I felt so uncomfortable I pulled my shirt right back on.  He continues trying to pursuade me and once again I say I don't want to but he pressed me against himself and kisses me again and tries taking off my shirt again. I was really uncomfortable and finally after multiple failed attempts to convince me to sleep with him he lets me go. I sit across from him just staring at him because it was hard to process what just happened. As I sit across from him he ""apologizes."" He says ""my bad, my bad"". He hands me the blunt and I stayed until it was finished.

Title: Im confused
Body: I believe I've been sexually assaulted. Story time.... I (16f) was texting with a (20m)that I knew from work. He invited me over to smoke and I agreed. Looking back I realized that he must've taken some of our chat sexual even though I had no intentions of being sexual. The ""sexual"" comments I'm talking about would be how I said I would shower and get ready and I take it he must of thought I was freshening up and getting prepared for sex. If I had known he wanted to hook up I definitely wouldn't have gone but me being stupid and naive I thought we were gonna have a chill smoke sesh and that's it yk. So anyway he pays for my Uber over to his apartment and takes me to his room. At this point we're talking and chilling smoking nic while he rolls and prepares the blunt. It's ready so we start smoking and he goes ""do you know how to do a ghost?"" I answered no and he's like ""come over let me show you."" After he says that I go from sitting on a chair across him to sitting right next to him in his bed. Right when I got next to him he starts touching all over me sexually. I start getting nervous and uncomfortable. I try to push myself away from him but he pulls me in and continues on with sexual touch. I said ""I don't think I can do this"" and instead of stopping he pulls me closer and kisses me. That's when I got really uncomfortable and told him I'm not ready for this. He says ""please it'll be alright"" ""c'mon you just look so good."" I tell him I don't think I can do this and still he doesn't stop. He starts taking off my shirt and I felt so uncomfortable I pulled my shirt right back on.  He continues trying to pursuade me and once again I say I don't want to but he pressed me against himself and kisses me again and tries taking off my shirt again. I was really uncomfortable and finally after multiple failed attempts to convince me to sleep with him he lets me go. I sit across from him just staring at him because it was hard to process what just happened. As I sit across from him he ""apologizes."" He says ""my bad, my bad"". He hands me the blunt and I stayed until it was finished. It just felt so awkward and I didn't know how to leave because I was just processing how this actually happened.Also if anyone is wondering yes he knew I was 16 and with every move I kept saying things like""I'm only 16"" and ""but I'm a lot younger than you"" ""I can't do this I'm 16""etc. Reminder he was 20 and knew I was 16 even before going to his place as I told him though text.

Content: YES this is SA. It’s a red flag from the start that he wanted to smoke with a 16 year old, tf? I’m 21 and when my flatmates 16 y o sister came to stay at our flat for the weekend, I viewed her as a kid (bc she is one)- we cooked her dinner, and tried to show her the city. We didn’t drink or smoke with her bc we’re adults and she’s a kid! We felt a sense of parental duty to her! 

Not only this, but this man seems like he had sex in mind from the start, which is why he gave you weed, I guess to make you a bit ‘looser’ and in the mood. 

All of these red flags aside, he deliberately ignored your explicit verbal consent, multiple times. I am so sorry this happened to you. 

Personally I think that yes, you should report him. He gave drugs to a 16 y o and sexually assaulted you. If you don’t want to go down the reporting route which I agree can be scary and uncomfortable, I would recommend trying to access support for yourself. Some charities give free therapy for victims of SA. See if you can tell your parents or anyone you trust.","Information support, Emotional support, Network support, Group interactions"

I couldn’t go on the trip since i had work, so i was staying home to house sit and feed our animals. My stepdad recently put up new cameras outside so I didn’t see anything wrong with him positioning one outside my window. Come to find out the very next day, I had my boyfriend stay over and he found that the surveillance camera that was ran from outside my window and into my room was being powered by one of those spy camera power blocks. 

For context, my relationship with my stepdad hasn’t always been the best and we tend to butt heads a lot. He’s said a lot of questionable things in the past that i’ve written off because he’s my dad and i would never think he intended to be inappropriate or harmful. He’s been in my life since i was 8 years old. Of course I’m second guessing everything now that i’ve found this camera. It was positioned to point directly at my bedroom door from the far wall, so it has direct view of my entire room, which i change in. 

I tried desperately to rationalize it and think it was maybe a mistake, like he grabbed the wrong charger box. Or maybe he was just trying to look for intruders. But really there is no excuse for putting a camera in MY bedroom. the camera even had an SD card in it. I’m beyond devastated. My stepdad even suggested i invite my boyfriend over to while they’re gone so i have someone here, which is something he would never do considering he’s made it clear before he doesn’t want him over when no one is home because he doesn’t want us ‘fucking in his home’. My boyfriend and I are going to go through the SD card to see if there is anything on it.

I’m at a complete loss at how to even bring this up to my mom. I confided in my aunt and uncle since they live close by and they have been very supportive of me having a conversation with my mom about it. This whole situation is extremely upsetting, I at least have some family to support me as i navigate this but i don’t even know how to bring this up to my mom. This is obviously going to change everything. She had my five year old half brother with him. 

My mind is racing with the consequences this is going to have on our family. Has anyone that has been in a similar situation have advice? How can i do this without causing extreme damage to the family (although that may be impossible). Thank you in advance.

TLDR; i found a hidden camera that my stepdad put in my room, how do i bring this up to my mom?

UPDATE(1/?):

I don’t want to make a whole new thread since i want to make a new update when my parents get back monday, but i want to thank everyone for all the advice. i went to the police station tonight and filed a police report and turned in the spy camera with the SD card. The officer said this is a serious offense and i will likely get a call early next week from an investigator due to the severity of the situation. I’m planning on telling my mother about the police report after we have a conversation about this on monday, with my aunt and uncle present. 

As for people messaging me about my profile: thank you for reminding me to delete personal information. Please please do not dox or try to seek any sort of justice for me as this may affect my case. Respect my privacy during this time please as it may be crucial during this investigation.

This was the hardest thing i ever had to do, but whatever this shit was, it’s ending with me. I hope i can get justice for myself and any other victims who may have been violated by him since this will be heavily investigated and the officer said it will likely be looked into further (such as search warrants and looking for more SD cards). i’m hanging on by a thread but the support i have is what’s keeping me together. i’m staying with my boyfriend tonight to keep out of the house. Thanks again for all the love and supportive messages. I’ll update again soon.

UPDATE (2/?)

it’s the next morning and once my boyfriend wakes up we’re going back to my house today to look for any more secret cameras (either in the bathroom or my brothers rooms) so i can submit it for more evidence. i’m iffy about searching my parents room for more evidence as it’s likely he has a hidden camera in there to see me do it. still on the fence about having a police officer search the house, if i do i’ll be sure to update after i’m finished and in a safe place. my aunt has offered to come with me to help me search.

again, thank you everyone for the support. i’m trying as best i can to do this the right way and get as much done with the time i have left. i’m mentally and emotionally drained but i’ll be seeking resources once all of this is said and done. i’m reading everyone’s comments so i’m taking all the advice i can get.

UPDATE (3/?)

i probably won’t be able to update for a few days since today is the day that i talk to my mom, but i just wanted to share the plan i made and hopes for what happens today.

after talking with my aunt, uncle, boyfriend, and my cousin who is a civil lawyer, i’ve decided that i will speak to my mom in a separate location from my stepdad. most likely i’ll have her meet me somewhere outside of our home. i’ll have my aunt with me and this is where i’ll explain everything to her: the camera, past uncomfortable experiences i’ve had with my stepdad that i originally brushed off because he was my dad, video footage of him deliberately setting it up and angling it, and footage of me in my room. im praying she understands why i had to go to my aunt instead of her considering she was not in town and i was worried for her safety if i told her what happened. (she was stuck with him and my brothers about 4 hours away for the weekend) 

i’m hoping with my aunt there and her being away from my stepdad that it’ll prevent her from reacting out of anger and search for him and escalate the situation then and there, and i hope my aunt can provide some support for myself and her. i’m prepared for her to go through the same processes i went through such as reasoning and denial, but with the evidence there’s no possible way she can deny it. i’m preparing myself for the worst. i just hope that i can be strong for her and support her as this all hits her like it did me. 

i will not be returning home or facing him today. my boyfriend will be on standby to pick up my brothers if needed since my aunt has offered for them to stay with us so my mom can talk to my stepdad without them there. i’ll ask my mom to meet me and of course, not tell my stepdad about the circumstances. maybe she can tell him she’s going to the grocery store. i don’t want him getting any hints that she could be meeting
with me. 

i know i’ve said it a lot but i truly do appreciate the support system i have not only with my family but here too. this has been a nightmare but hearing everyone’s stories about this, proving it’s way too common, is what is helping me get through this and pushing me to do the right thing. not only am i a victim in this but my boyfriend as well and god knows who else. the confrontation won’t happen for about another 7 hours so i’m the meantime i’ll be reading over comments and preparing myself for what comes today. thank you guys.","Original Post:

I would gather evidence, as already stated. My concern is how long has he been doing this and how many people are affected.

Content: i’m very concerned about this as well. i have two brothers who are minors and he’s been in my life for over 14 years now so who’s to say he hasn’t recorded me before or even them. or even distributed it. it’s so terribly devastating to come to terms with him being this evil. he even installed these cameras while i was asleep so there’s no doubt he was hoping i wouldn’t notice.

1jv8dfu,,relationship_advice,mm86ksb,t3_1jv8dfu,0,[deleted],"First of all, everyone reading this knows that your husband was wrong to take advantage of you in your state.  However, you don't seem to own anything in the series of choices you made that lead you to this state to be taken advantage of.

Your first mistake was choosing to have your first experience with edibles away from a safe environment.  Your second mistake is two-fold but centers on this ""idea"" that you have no autonomy and must (A) accept drinking challenges, and (B) accept an insistence that you ""finish"" the edible.

YOU DID NOT HAVE TO DO ANY OF THOSE THINGS.

So, that is the part of this situation . . . if you will . . . the fostering of the situation that you must own.

Granted, your husband is an a-hole and complicit in you getting in this state in which you lost your bodily autonomy.  He is also so very wrong to take advantage of you in that state.

Yes, you must talk to him about it.  If this is the second time that you have been encouraged to over-indulge in substances to the point of losing bodily autonomy and he has then taken advantage of you, this is a very big problem.  

If you cannot control your anxiety to discuss this and get him to understand how he was wrong, and agree to never do this again, then at a minimum you need to stop drinking and using mind-altering substances because you have neither the maturity to use them responsibly nor the ability to exert the word ""no"" when you start.",1,1744212694,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1jv8dfu/my_22f_husband_27m_took_advantage_of_my_body/mm86ksb/,FALSE,"My (22F) husband (27m) took advantage of my body while I was high, how do I confront him about it?

Content: First of all, everyone reading this knows that your husband was wrong to take advantage of you in your state.  However, you don't seem to own anything in the series of choices you made that lead you to this state to be taken advantage of.

Your first mistake was choosing to have your first experience with edibles away from a safe environment.  Your second mistake is two-fold but centers on this ""idea"" that you have no autonomy and must (A) accept drinking challenges, and (B) accept an insistence that you ""finish"" the edible.

YOU DID NOT HAVE TO DO ANY OF THOSE THINGS.

So, that is the part of this situation . . . if you will . . . the fostering of the situation that you must own.

Granted, your husband is an a-hole and complicit in you getting in this state in which you lost your bodily autonomy.  He is also so very wrong to take advantage of you in that state.

Yes, you must talk to him about it.  If this is the second time that you have been encouraged to over-indulge in substances to the point of losing bodily autonomy and he has then taken advantage of you, this is a very big problem.  

If you cannot control your anxiety to discuss this and get him to understand how he was wrong, and agree to never do this again, then at a minimum you need to stop drinking and using mind-altering substances because you have neither the maturity to use them responsibly nor the ability to exert the word ""no"" when you start.",Information support

Eventually the relationship ended. They got sick of me and I’m glad for it. I was depressed as fuck as the time but now I look back I’m very happy. They exploited me at a time when I was vunerable because I was in a terrible position with family and exams and my best friend also manipulating and abandoning me.

I met my boyfriend when I was 18 online, but we didn’t meet in person until a year later, we only video chatted, texted, and called frequently. I wanted to wait until we met in person to decide if we’d make things official, but he was very persistent, he asked me everyday to officially date for about 3 weeks, so I agreed, because I was genuinely interested in him and wanted to see where things would lead.

As a preface, I had told him before we met that I didn’t want sexual things to happen. I noticed in person that he was very touchy and affectionate, more so than I would’ve been since it was so early on in the relationship, but it didn’t seem to be in an overbearing way. Around our fourth date, after the day was over and it was dark outside, he pulled me into the backseat of his car and started to try to reach under my pants, and then under my underwear, etc, while kissing me. While he was doing this I was really nervous because it was my first time and it was also way too soon for me to want to do that. I also have a hard time hiding my facial expressions, so people can read me easily, so I would be really surprised if he didn’t see that I was anxious and uncomfortable. But I didn’t verbally tell him no.
While he was doing it, I would push his hand away and look at him uncomfortably, and then we would just sit for a bit and talk, and then he would try to do it again, and it would all repeat.

He also moved my hand onto his crotch and I would yank it back, and then he would pull it back over again. It’s hard for me to remember everything that happened, but I remember him laughing like I was being silly, and it was a game. And I remember him saying, “(My name), it’s not scary, you’re so scared of it, come on.” And I remember him making sad eyes at me like he was hurt, and feeling guilty like I did something wrong that was hurting him. At one point he asked me if I had done this before and when I said no, he apologized and said he didn’t know and then we cuddled for a few minutes. Then he moved my hand again, essentially guiding it to jack him off, before I pulled away, again. This happened on and off for a couple of hours. It almost felt like he thought he was dealing with a stubborn child rather than a nonconsenting and inexperienced partner. 

Before our next date he told me he was going to go down on me, and I asked him not to, saying that I really wasn’t ready for it yet, and he told me that he wouldn’t, and then at the end of the date he did it. Later that night he acknowledged that I said I didn’t want him to and apologized (without me bringing it up.) He also asked me several times each date to go down on him after I told him I didn’t want to and was uncomfortable with it. 

I processed this several months after the fact, as at that time I was so confused about the whole situation that I didn’t know how to respond to it (I’m also inexperienced with sex and the concepts of consent and coercion.) When I brought all of these things up to him, he apologized and said that he raped me, and said that he was a bad person. I responded that he didn’t, and that he wasn’t bad, and spent the rest of the night consoling him because he has a tendency to get depressed and I was very afraid he would hurt himself. 

I brought it up several months later because I kept getting flashbacks and I was bothered that I didn’t understand what had happened with my partner, who otherwise has treated me extremely well and has always showered me in love. The second time I got some more clarity about it, but there was also arguing, he became very angry that I brought it up again and asked me how I dare question his intentions after all he’s done for me, and how he was planning on proposing and he’s only ever been good to me. He said that he didn’t rape me and did think I wanted it, (to clarify I never accused him of rape, I just asked for clarity on the situation.) And then he said he just thought I was scared and he wanted to show me it wasn’t scary. He said he was pissed and disgusted that I would question him about it, saying that I knew he would never do anything to hurt me, and that I was just using this as an excuse to find fault in him and leave him because I wasn’t ready for a serious relationship. After this conversation I told him I needed space to process things, and he told me I was abusing him by making him think I’ll leave.

So now I’m left in a place of confusion. I’ve debated whether I didn’t do enough, whether I should’ve loudly told him no or shoved him off harder. I wonder if he knew that I was saying no and didn’t care, or if he genuinely somehow misinterpreted things. 

I think about what I should’ve done differently, and try to understand why things happened the way they did. But what I do know is that in those moments I was afraid and confused. I couldn’t wrap my head around why my nonverbal no didn’t matter, and that it was being ignored by someone that I trusted. And it made me worry that even if I tried harder, nothing would make it stop. And it might get worse. I debate whether it was due to my bad communication, him just being a more sexually driven person but not intending to cross my boundaries, or whether he really did know he was hurting me, and didn’t care. I had a dream about it recently, so now I’m thinking about what it all means again. I care about this person a lot and it’s difficult for me to process this and try to understand it.

I haven’t talked to many people about this situation, and I’m not sure if it’ll go completely unread, but it’s at least helpful to articulate my thoughts on it.","Original Post:

Content: This guy sounds bad OP.  If it's not outright rape, he's at least been pushing you to do things he knew you weren't ready for.  His initial sadness saying he raped you sounds like a ploy to get you to reverse it and say he didnt.  I think his most recent reaction of anger is anger that it hasn't gone away and he's trying to make you the bad guy for doubting him.  He's suddenly angry when he previously felt so guilty?  That makes no sense.

I was in an abusive relationship at the age of 14-15. I'm now 18. I used to dismiss what happened (losing my virginity), but now I'm remembering more.
I blocked the majority of it out at the time because I was scared. Obviously, I'm not bringing it up now to gain sympathy, or ""ruin"" that guy's life. I'm just wondering if I was r*ped because of the details that I am now remembering.
I don't remember in part, I think, because it was too traumatizing for me. Here's what I remember:
The first time it happened, I told him no. He didn't listen. I thought it was my fault because I didn't say no directly. I was too scared (of him). Instead, I said something like, ""oh, your mom is going to be home soon, right?"" He then called his mom and confirmed that she was going to be out for another hour or so.
Second time, I remember that I felt bad. I had been turning him down for months. I was into the making out, but I wasn't ready. I do feel like that was taken from me.
Lastly, and this might be disturbing to some, I remember telling him to stop and crying because it hurt. He wouldn't stop. I told him to stop several times, I was bawling, but he laid on top of me.
After I broke up with this guy, he went to a mental hospital. He told me that he was going to overdose, so I called the cops. He had a warrant out for his arrest, too.
He was very angry with me. I blocked all of his social media accounts, but he then bought 5 or 6 burner phones. He called me, my friends, and my family. This happened until I moved away and changed my number.
In the relationship, I remember that he would shove me. He yelled at me every. Single. Night. I always was crying because of something he said. 
Please, please don't make any jokes responding to this. I've heard it all. ""I don't blame him, you're so pretty!""
 I don't know why all of these memories are suddenly coming back to me, but I don't like it. Can someone please explain what the fuck I'm supposed to do now? Telling my parents is, and will never be an option. I'm looking to you now, strangers.","Original Post:

Second time, I remember that I felt bad. I had been turning him down for months. I was into the making out, but I wasn't ready. I do feel like that was taken from me.
Lastly, and this might be disturbing to some, I remember telling him to stop and crying because it hurt. He wouldn't stop. I told him to stop several times, I was bawling, but he laid on top of me.
After I broke up with this guy, he went to a mental hospital. He told me that he was going to overdose, so I called the cops. He had a warrant out for his arrest, too.
He was very angry with me. I blocked all of his social media accounts, but he then bought 5 or 6 burner phones. He called me, my friends, and my family. This happened until I moved away and changed my number.
In the relationship, I remember that he would shove me. He yelled at me every. Single. Night. I always was crying because of something he said. 
Please, please don't make any jokes responding to this. I've heard it all. ""I don't blame him, you're so pretty!""
 I don't know why all of these memories are suddenly coming back to me, but I don't like it. Can someone please explain what the fuck I'm supposed to do now? Telling my parents is, and will never be an option. I'm looking to you now, strangers.

Content: After writing this, I almost had a panic attack. I decided to tell my parents and understandably, they were shocked. But now, I think since I've told them, I'm going to finally feel better. 
Therapy is what my mom suggested too, but I really think that I'm okay now.

Apparently as the night went out I had too much the drink and blacked out, even to the point where I was laying in my own vomit (I was filled in regarding this the next day, i didn’t even recall vomiting and had to ask if I threw up at all)

Somehow I end up in the shower and I hear someone come in, I look out, and see her in the bathroom closing the door, naked. 

Things are kind of hazy from this point on but i vaguely remember “hooking up” in the bathroom, in the backseat of my car, and the spare bedroom.

I remember her being frustrated that she couldn’t get me hard and I remember not really knowing what’s going on.

She says she only came into the bathroom to help me because I was falling in the tub and she wanted to help. So it doesn’t add up to me why she would’ve needed to be naked to do that? 

Earlier in the night I send an incoherent text (i can’t post an images here or i would post a screenshot), which i then showed my friend and my friend even commented “Yeah what, For her to read your texts like that, It’s clear that you were beyond drunk”

and they believe, as well as chatGPT believes, I was sexually assaulted but i’m having a hard time believing it.

I remember her being on top trying to get me hard and saying to put a baby in her. And I’m 99% sure we didn’t use protection but she says we did. 

We ended up hooking up in the bathroom, my car, and the spare bedroom.

When I asked her about the situation due to concerns regarding consent she said she was only in the bathroom because I was falling in the tub. She says when she tried to help me up that’s when I tried to kiss her. I don’t remember so that may be true but my question is why would she have needed to be naked to help me up? 

She then said I was bothering her all night and even had to tell me to stop trying to kiss her. She says she went to sleep in the spare bedroom, i wanted to come with her, and she told me no and turned me away.

She also says we used protection. But the thing is a specifically remember having sex in the spare bed and I specifically remember not using protection (because it was later in the night/morning when I was less drunk).

She also completely omitted the hookup in the backseat of the car in her retelling of the story, which I do remember. She was on top of me in the bathroom and in the backseat, and I vaguely remember her saying put a baby in me. 

After having this conversation with her responses were “ I don't like how this sound I took advantage of you cause that's DEFINITELY not the case”, “ LMFAO”, “Sorry to laugh but raping you is crazy”, and “Im actually offended”

I don’t remember initiating sex, I just remember kind of slowly regaining consciousness briefly while she was on top of me, but I couldn’t feel anything.

Again she did say I was coming onto her so maybe I asked for it? Based on her reply and how easily she dismissed it, it makes me feel like i’m overreacting or my memories are wrong.

Was this sexual assault? Am I overthinking? Just a drunk hookup? I don’t remember the actual act itself for the most part other than 5-10 second snippets sporadically. 

Sorry if this story is a little messy or incoherent but i’m just trying to piece everything together. I know my friend said it was sexual assault and so did chatGPT but for some reason i’m having a hard time believing that so I’m here on reddit to get more opinions. ","Original Post:

Content: It seems like it might be sexual assault to me. When you said no and she kept doing it she was ignoring your lack of consent. I’m sorry this happened that sounds like a really stressful situation. If you feel like you need to tell someone, do. It’s unfair on you as well as to her bf! Once again, I’m sorry. That’s a horrible situation to be in ❤️

He was very good at making it seem like he cared about what I was going through, but the pressure was constant and confusing.

Sometimes during sex, he would “accidentally” put it somewhere I didn’t want and keep going while I froze then would get angry if I would be upset about it saying I didnt say “no” in the moment even though I would say it in the beginning and in the moment I would be too shocked to say anything.

Once during my period, he said vaginal sex was “haram” because of his religion, but backdoor sex was allowed and when I said I dont think it is he lied about asking his spiritual coach about it. When I found out he lied to get what he wanted I cried so much.

Not to mention I would have backdoor sex because he would say manipulative things like “you know…sometimes you have some sexual things you like that if your partner doesnt fulfil you always wonder how it would be like to do it” (implying it makes someone want to cheat)

14c0udv,TemperatureAlone6712@1,relationship_advice,jpj2bzk,t1_jpj27ih,2,rico_muerte,Thank you,1,1687738077,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/14c0udv/i_21f_found_a_spy_camera_in_my_room_after_my_step/jpj2bzk/,FALSE,I (21F) found a spy camera in my room after my step dad (36M) put a surveillance camera in my window,katiedababie,"My stepdad (36M) installed a surveillance camera positioned outside of my window to scan our backyard while him and my mother and two younger brothers go camping. I couldn’t go on the trip since i had work, so i was staying home to house sit and feed our animals. My stepdad recently put up new cameras outside so I didn’t see anything wrong with him positioning one outside my window. Come to find out the very next day, I had my boyfriend stay over and he found that the surveillance camera that was ran from outside my window and into my room was being powered by one of those spy camera power blocks. 

For context, my relationship with my stepdad hasn’t always been the best and we tend to butt heads a lot. He’s said a lot of questionable things in the past that i’ve written off because he’s my dad and i would never think he intended to be inappropriate or harmful. He’s been in my life since i was 8 years old. Of course I’m second guessing everything now that i’ve found this camera. It was positioned to point directly at my bedroom door from the far wall, so it has direct view of my entire room, which i change in. 

I tried desperately to rationalize it and think it was maybe a mistake, like he grabbed the wrong charger box. Or maybe he was just trying to look for intruders. But really there is no excuse for putting a camera in MY bedroom. the camera even had an SD card in it. I’m beyond devastated. My stepdad even suggested i invite my boyfriend over to while they’re gone so i have someone here, which is something he would never do considering he’s made it clear before he doesn’t want him over when no one is home because he doesn’t want us ‘fucking in his home’. My boyfriend and I are going to go through the SD card to see if there is anything on it.

I’m at a complete loss at how to even bring this up to my mom. I confided in my aunt and uncle since they live close by and they have been very supportive of me having a conversation with my mom about it. This whole situation is extremely upsetting, I at least have some family to support me as i navigate this but i don’t even know how to bring this up to my mom. This is obviously going to change everything. She had my five year old half brother with him. 

My mind is racing with the consequences this is going to have on our family. Has anyone that has been in a similar situation have advice? How can i do this without causing extreme damage to the family (although that may be impossible). Thank you in advance.

TLDR; i found a hidden camera that my stepdad put in my room, how do i bring this up to my mom?

UPDATE(1/?):

I don’t want to make a whole new thread since i want to make a new update when my parents get back monday, but i want to thank everyone for all the advice. i went to the police station tonight and filed a police report and turned in the spy camera with the SD card. The officer said this is a serious offense and i will likely get a call early next week from an investigator due to the severity of the situation. I’m planning on telling my mother about the police report after we have a conversation about this on monday, with my aunt and uncle present. 

As for people messaging me about my profile: thank you for reminding me to delete personal information. Please please do not dox or try to seek any sort of justice for me as this may affect my case. Respect my privacy during this time please as it may be crucial during this investigation.

This was the hardest thing i ever had to do, but whatever this shit was, it’s ending with me. I hope i can get justice for myself and any other victims who may have been violated by him since this will be heavily investigated and the officer said it will likely be looked into further (such as search warrants and looking for more SD cards). i’m hanging on by a thread but the support i have is what’s keeping me together. i’m staying with my boyfriend tonight to keep out of the house. Thanks again for all the love and supportive messages. I’ll update again soon.

UPDATE (2/?)

it’s the next morning and once my boyfriend wakes up we’re going back to my house today to look for any more secret cameras (either in the bathroom or my brothers rooms) so i can submit it for more evidence. i’m iffy about searching my parents room for more evidence as it’s likely he has a hidden camera in there to see me do it. still on the fence about having a police officer search the house, if i do i’ll be sure to update after i’m finished and in a safe place. my aunt has offered to come with me to help me search.

again, thank you everyone for the support. i’m trying as best i can to do this the right way and get as much done with the time i have left. i’m mentally and emotionally drained but i’ll be seeking resources once all of this is said and done. i’m reading everyone’s comments so i’m taking all the advice i can get.

UPDATE (3/?)

i probably won’t be able to update for a few days since today is the day that i talk to my mom, but i just wanted to share the plan i made and hopes for what happens today.

after talking with my aunt, uncle, boyfriend, and my cousin who is a civil lawyer, i’ve decided that i will speak to my mom in a separate location from my stepdad. most likely i’ll have her meet me somewhere outside of our home. i’ll have my aunt with me and this is where i’ll explain everything to her: the camera, past uncomfortable experiences i’ve had with my stepdad that i originally brushed off because he was my dad, video footage of him deliberately setting it up and angling it, and footage of me in my room. im praying she understands why i had to go to my aunt instead of her considering she was not in town and i was worried for her safety if i told her what happened. (she was stuck with him and my brothers about 4 hours away for the weekend) 

i’m hoping with my aunt there and her being away from my stepdad that it’ll prevent her from reacting out of anger and search for him and escalate the situation then and there, and i hope my aunt can provide some support for myself and her. i’m prepared for her to go through the same processes i went through such as reasoning and denial, but with the evidence there’s no possible way she can deny it. i’m preparing myself for the worst. i just hope that i can be strong for her and support her as this all hits her like it did me. 

i will not be returning home or facing him today. my boyfriend will be on standby to pick up my brothers if needed since my aunt has offered for them to stay with us so my mom can talk to my stepdad without them there. i’ll ask my mom to meet me and of course, not tell my stepdad about the circumstances. maybe she can tell him she’s going to the grocery store. i don’t want him getting any hints that she could be meeting
with me. 

i know i’ve said it a lot but i truly do appreciate the support system i have not only with my family but here too. this has been a nightmare but hearing everyone’s stories about this, proving it’s way too common, is what is helping me get through this and pushing me to do the right thing. not only am i a victim in this but my boyfriend as well and god knows who else. the confrontation won’t happen for about another 7 hours so i’m the meantime i’ll be reading over comments and preparing myself for what comes today. thank you guys.","Original Post:

Title: I (21F) found a spy camera in my room after my step dad (36M) put a surveillance camera in my window
Body: My stepdad (36M) installed a surveillance camera positioned outside of my window to scan our backyard while him and my mother and two younger brothers go camping. I couldn’t go on the trip since i had work, so i was staying home to house sit and feed our animals. My stepdad recently put up new cameras outside so I didn’t see anything wrong with him positioning one outside my window. Come to find out the very next day, I had my boyfriend stay over and he found that the surveillance camera that was ran from outside my window and into my room was being powered by one of those spy camera power blocks. 

For context, my relationship with my stepdad hasn’t always been the best and we tend to butt heads a lot. He’s said a lot of questionable things in the past that i’ve written off because he’s my dad and i would never think he intended to be inappropriate or harmful. He’s been in my life since i was 8 years old. Of course I’m second guessing everything now that i’ve found this camera. It was positioned to point directly at my bedroom door from the far wall, so it has direct view of my entire room, which i change in. 

I tried desperately to rationalize it and think it was maybe a mistake, like he grabbed the wrong charger box. Or maybe he was just trying to look for intruders. But really there is no excuse for putting a camera in MY bedroom. the camera even had an SD card in it. I’m beyond devastated. My stepdad even suggested i invite my boyfriend over to while they’re gone so i have someone here, which is something he would never do considering he’s made it clear before he doesn’t want him over when no one is home because he doesn’t want us ‘fucking in his home’. My boyfriend and I are going to go through the SD card to see if there is anything on it.

I’m at a complete loss at how to even bring this up to my mom. I confided in my aunt and uncle since they live close by and they have been very supportive of me having a conversation with my mom about it. This whole situation is extremely upsetting, I at least have some family to support me as i navigate this but i don’t even know how to bring this up to my mom. This is obviously going to change everything. She had my five year old half brother with him. 

My mind is racing with the consequences this is going to have on our family. Has anyone that has been in a similar situation have advice? How can i do this without causing extreme damage to the family (although that may be impossible). Thank you in advance.

TLDR; i found a hidden camera that my stepdad put in my room, how do i bring this up to my mom?

UPDATE(1/?):

I don’t want to make a whole new thread since i want to make a new update when my parents get back monday, but i want to thank everyone for all the advice. i went to the police station tonight and filed a police report and turned in the spy camera with the SD card. The officer said this is a serious offense and i will likely get a call early next week from an investigator due to the severity of the situation. I’m planning on telling my mother about the police report after we have a conversation about this on monday, with my aunt and uncle present. 

As for people messaging me about my profile: thank you for reminding me to delete personal information. Please please do not dox or try to seek any sort of justice for me as this may affect my case. Respect my privacy during this time please as it may be crucial during this investigation.

This was the hardest thing i ever had to do, but whatever this shit was, it’s ending with me. I hope i can get justice for myself and any other victims who may have been violated by him since this will be heavily investigated and the officer said it will likely be looked into further (such as search warrants and looking for more SD cards). i’m hanging on by a thread but the support i have is what’s keeping me together. i’m staying with my boyfriend tonight to keep out of the house. Thanks again for all the love and supportive messages. I’ll update again soon.

UPDATE (2/?)

it’s the next morning and once my boyfriend wakes up we’re going back to my house today to look for any more secret cameras (either in the bathroom or my brothers rooms) so i can submit it for more evidence. i’m iffy about searching my parents room for more evidence as it’s likely he has a hidden camera in there to see me do it. still on the fence about having a police officer search the house, if i do i’ll be sure to update after i’m finished and in a safe place. my aunt has offered to come with me to help me search.

again, thank you everyone for the support. i’m trying as best i can to do this the right way and get as much done with the time i have left. i’m mentally and emotionally drained but i’ll be seeking resources once all of this is said and done. i’m reading everyone’s comments so i’m taking all the advice i can get.

UPDATE (3/?)

i probably won’t be able to update for a few days since today is the day that i talk to my mom, but i just wanted to share the plan i made and hopes for what happens today.

after talking with my aunt, uncle, boyfriend, and my cousin who is a civil lawyer, i’ve decided that i will speak to my mom in a separate location from my stepdad. most likely i’ll have her meet me somewhere outside of our home. i’ll have my aunt with me and this is where i’ll explain everything to her: the camera, past uncomfortable experiences i’ve had with my stepdad that i originally brushed off because he was my dad, video footage of him deliberately setting it up and angling it, and footage of me in my room. im praying she understands why i had to go to my aunt instead of her considering she was not in town and i was worried for her safety if i told her what happened.

When I (18F) was with my ex (19M) a year ago we decided to have sex, which I hadn't done before, but he had. The first time was nice, even though it hurt for me, but the second time we did was awful. I was looking forward to doing it again because I thought it wouldn't hurt the second time, but it did. It hurt much, much worse than the first time so he kept switching positions trying to find one that was ok for me. After a while it became clear that wouldn't happen and my clit and the whole area became sore. So I asked him if we couldn't do it another time and he said ""no, you promised we would do it today, let's try something else"". This went back and forth and I told him I was sore. Then, because he insisted we continue, I half-heartedly said I would give him a blowjob, which I didn't really want to and I thought he would refuse (kind of like when you offer to borrow someone money but make it clear you'd rather not and it's like a last resort offer). He then pulled out and I rolled over to my side but then he looks at me and said ""go on now"". I asked ""what?"" and he said ""well, you said you would blow me, go on now"". So I did it, because I had indeed said I would. And besides, I could have just gotten up or bluntly said no and he would have accepted it, I just suck at boundaries. 

Anyway, if I were to read the post above I'd say it's obviously SA but it didn't feel that way for me. I'm not traumatized or affected by it in any way and I don't see myself as a victim. I just want to know if this was just a bad experience or not. I should also mention I'm writing this post because I'm now in a good relationship and my boyfriend strongly contrasts this asshole but I'm sometimes reminded of him and I get grossed out.

I would gather evidence, as already stated. My concern is how long has he been doing this and how many people are affected. 

Trust your gut.

Content: i’m very concerned about this as well. i have two brothers who are minors and he’s been in my life for over 14 years now so who’s to say he hasn’t recorded me before or even them. or even distributed it. it’s so terribly devastating to come to terms with him being this evil. he even installed these cameras while i was asleep so there’s no doubt he was hoping i wouldn’t notice.

nzamuq,,sexualassault,h1p9dge,t3_nzamuq,0,gasstationsushi80,I'm so sorry this happened to you. It is absolutely rape. This man is a predator who finds pleasure in the pain of others. He deserves prison time.,1,1623648585,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/nzamuq/was_i_actually_raped_or_was_he_just_rough/h1p9dge/,FALSE,"Was I actually raped, or was he just ‘rough’?",pprobablyneedtherapy,"I’m so sorry in advance that this is so scarily long. 

I haven’t really thought about it until this constant feeling of anger that I’ve been having the whole of today. Anger about everything. Especially anger about how reporting my sexual assault and trying to seek medical help for it has been so difficult (dismissing my assault to “it’s not rape / it’s consensual sex and this was just ‘roughness’ / closed your case since no offences were committed; being turned away from the GP and the A&amp;E that the GP referred me to; then being forced to pay nearly $600 for a forensic exam that I did not ask for, that would otherwise be free for sexual assault victims with a ‘police form’ which had not been given to me, a victim of penetrative sexual assault, because a male sexual crimes officer concluded that my experience was 100% consensual sex with a case of “roughness”)   — re-traumatising is putting it lightly. 

I actually started thinking it over and over (mainly because they were intrusive thoughts and i would get stuck in them, and here i am again) and trying to comprehend something so traumatic to me was seen as just “roughness” to the sexual crimes investigating officer who handled my case. They had to tell me, “this isn’t rape”. And I’ve been crying in bed figuring out how my situation was not rape, or even not considered sexual assault. 

Basically I’ve been meeting up with complete strangers for sex because I wanted to hurt myself. Dealing with an intense fear of when I get raped, complete hopelessness over my safety in this world, intense and uncharacteristic hypersexuality (with very dark and disturbing themes), and using sex as self-injury to cheapen myself further because I feel like I deserve it. I mean, just give the men what they’ve consistently shown me that they wanted, right? 

I met this 48 year old man (I’m 23) from online (hookup site). He did not give me good vibes over text because he was very demanding about my attention, and needing to give him immediate replies. People like this give me bad feelings, and he wanted to meet the next day, and I said okay. He booked a day hotel. I had second thoughts that same night but ignored it. We had discussed that even if he was rough, he would be respectful if I needed to stop, and I thought I could trust him. I told him I would show up with a present for him underneath my work clothes, and I had dressed up for him. I showed up at the hotel, realised he brought some BDSM stuff (we did not discuss this — we only discussed sex) and was basically like, well ok he’s a Dom. 

He wanted to go straight to anal and I said okay. I don’t remember if my hands were tied / chained together. He got me to lie down in missionary on the edge of the very bed, and he put himself inside of me while standing up, holding onto my legs with my feet near by his shoulders. Initially it was painful while inserting because he was huge and my tiny hole is 100% not. But it subsided and it started off okay. Then he started slamming it really deep and it was beginning to hurt a lot. He was hitting some kind of wall, all the way inside of my rectum (he was above 15cm I believe, might’ve been 17–20cm — I am still unsure of what he was hitting against), because he was going nearly balls deep. 

I started to use my hands to push his hips and legs away, at first to pace and then to actually push him away. I wanted to tell him to stop but I couldn’t get the words out for some reason. I started crying and he saw me tearing up and looking scared as shit (my face wasn’t one of contentment or release, it was anguish and fear). He stopped, asked me why I was crying. I told him that I was in a lot of pain / it was really painful. And he said, “cry harder”, readjusted my hips and held onto my legs again, and went even deeper and rougher and faster. He did it knowing that I was really in pain and already in tears and pushing against his hips and thighs because of it, and that he would cause me even more pain by doing so, and still did it anyway because he wanted to see me cry even more. My body was twitching out of pain. My crying became [silent screaming and then wailing out loud](https://youtu.be/gS12lKPbjNI). The kind where you’re experiencing extreme distress and terror that you want to pull all of your hair out while hyperventilating — if y’all know what i’m talking about, I can’t find anything on YT that resembles that kind of wide-eyed silent-scream-crying? In my head I could see myself getting dressed and walking out of the door, yet I couldn’t move or do anything or say anything other than wail and hyperventilate and cry as everything hurt. 

When he finally stopped I was glad it was over. Again I wanted to leave as soon as he was out of me, but I couldn’t. I felt like he was owed the 3 hours that I’d told him I was free for, and I was scared to leave. I was worried that he was going to get violent if I tried. I ended up doing everything else that he wanted me to do, for 2 hours — I feel awful that I let myself believe I wanted this, it didn’t feel like full consent, but more of, I had no choice and that meant I’d just have to do it. I guess I could say I consented… the horribly painful vaginal sex, the unprotected blowjob where he would push my head down until he was at the back of my throat, having to ride him vaginally and anally (both quite painful, but not to the extent of involuntary body spasms). He would hit me (without asking) with the leather of his belt, on my breasts and butt, my back, my vagina, my stomach. He slapped me in the face. Hog-tied me so I couldn’t move. Said he would rape me / rape my holes. That he owned them and he owned me. He kept telling me to say “thank you master”. Kept saying things like “I know you want this white fat cock to rape your ass, yeah”, and referring to me as a Chinese whore / slut. He said he would send me to his friends for me to service them. He put a collar on me with a leash. 

I repeatedly said I needed to stop and take a break and he didn’t listen. He just did more stuff to me. Continued doing it non-stop, in different positions, different tools. 

The second time he intentionally caused me pain again was unprotected anal sex (he wanted to come in my ass), this time at the corner edge of the bed in a doggy position where he was standing up behind me. He just thrusted himself in all the way again quite quickly, and I basically audibly yelped / yowled, and my body crumpled. I started crying yet again. This time I was quite spaced out and my brain felt like cotton. He would ask questions and I wouldn’t be able to speak. Then from behind he suddenly grabbed me roughly by the front of the neck and used my throat to pull me up to him, which made his thrusting hurt even more. My body was twitching by itself again every single time he hit the “wall”. I felt nauseous. Holding onto my neck he told me to look at him (over my right shoulder), but i was in so much pain that i keeled over and got my elbows onto the bed. This time he put his knuckles into the fitting collar around my neck, pulled it taut, pressed his knuckles against my throat too, basically choking me, and pulled me up again. I felt lightheaded quite quickly and everything went slow and my hearing kind of went a bit distant while I was gasping for air. 

He told me to look at him again, and I couldn’t, and he jostled the collar and repeated his demand. I turned to look over at him. He told me to smile for him. I couldn’t smile. I couldn’t feel my face at all. Pretty sure my face was trembling from crying and wincing. He demanded it again and I tried and it felt so weird. It was such a wobbly smile. He told me to smile wider. I did it wider, until he was happy and let go of me and I went back onto my elbows again. He was asking me questions / making statements again and I just kept shaking my head to say no to everything. But I didn’t know what he was asking, I don’t really remember. He continued to thrust and then leaned over me and went really deep, and eventually pressed / pinned my entire body down (I went from being on all 4’s to lying flat with my stomach down) and came not long after that. 

I told him after that I couldn’t do it anymore. I needed a break at least. I was exhausted. He said okay, then kept stimulating what he thought was my clit (re: my fucking urethra) very roughly and kept telling me to come. I honestly faked maybe half of it, repeated that I needed a break and was really exhausted, and he would go for one more. This was maybe 8–10 times and he only finally stopped after that because I had to leave soon. 

I went home that evening feeling extremely physically and emotionally raw. I hated the feeling of his semen inside of me. Every time I had a bowel movement my anus seriously hurt (I ended up having a laceration). Every time I peed my vagina would hurt (raw skin on the posterior fourchette). Both were bleeding. I cried for hours that night. He texted me that he wanted to meet me again the next day. I told him I needed a break because I was feeling raw. He said “oh I didn’t realise you were actually in pain”, and I said “that’s why I was crying, I told you it was really painful”, and he said, “I have a crying kink”. Then he went on about how I should have been more assertive if I didn’t feel comfortable. He would have stopped. He was an extremely empathetic person. Had a lot of empathy. Said that there was a fine line between what’s comfortable and what’s unacceptable and that only I would know where that line is for myself. Basically very gaslighty. 

I was extremely depressed the next day. I had a really bad nightmare that same night (Thursday night / Friday morning) too, the worst one I ever had, full of death, suicide, gore, inescapable terror, and rape. I slept through work. Realised I also suffered a neck sprain or strain on the side that he made me turn to look at him. I ate. Cried. Didn’t talk to my family at all. Hid in my room. Slept through the afternoon. Did some work in the evening. Cried. Cried. Cried. Showered and cried. Went back to bed and cried. I blocked his number on Saturday. He contacted me on that hookup site and said “so mean of you to block me”, and that’s the last I’ve communicated with him. 

I feel very largely responsible for putting myself in this situation, knowing that this exact thing was going to be a risk. I mean, all of these meet-ups and being used by men were my way of controlling how I would feel when I eventually got raped, almost like each time I met a person it would be a ‘rehearsal’ for it. And I never once during the whole thing explicitly said “stop” or “no” or literally push him off me or kick him off, mainly because I’m very conflict-averse and if there’s a chance that he would get upset and hit me, which I think everyone would do to me, I wouldn’t physically do anything. I don’t know why I didn’t just get up and leave as soon as I had the chance. I don’t know why I stayed. I don’t know why I laid in bed with him after everything, just resting because I was exhausted. I even laughed at some things he said. 

I don’t know why I tried to convince myself that he was a good person, that because he asked me about my self-harm scars and said he liked me as a person and thought I was attractive (as a slightly chubby person) and a good fuck, that he wasn’t a monster. Even when he was trying to say all of the bullshit about needing to be assertive and all, I said, “yeah I know, it’s not your fault. I wasn’t communicating so you wouldn’t have known”. I can’t believe I said that. I’m so angry with myself, mad at everything I did, and also at everything else that I didn’t do. 

The main parts that I felt were a horrible violation, to me, were the moments where he was actively causing me pain and he knew I was crying and was struggling against him, and still did it anyway, at times by force. But I also can’t help but feel like I didn’t struggle enough, because maybe I should have. I feel like I just let this happen.

So I don’t know. This was what I told the officer inclusive of the pushing, crying, and that he intentionally caused me more pain and was choking me. But was this rape? Was this some kind of assault? Or was this really, truly just a case of ‘roughness’? 

I’ve honestly been getting very disheartened by having this experience be downplayed by the people that are supposed to help me feel safe, especially when they say it’s 100% consensual and just the man being rough. I feel ashamed for even having reported it, because it feels like I’m wasting their time over a not-assault. I feel like my reality of what happened and what I felt in the moment, isn’t real. Like if the people who are supposed to handle sexual assault cases don’t believe that there was anything remotely wrong with what he did, then what gives me the right to feel like something was forced onto (into) me? How do I trust my own judgment over what I felt in my own body, over someone else who supposedly knows better since they handle cases like these? I really don’t understand and I’m desperate to make it make sense…","Original Post:

Title: Was I actually raped, or was he just ‘rough’?
Body: I’m so sorry in advance that this is so scarily long. 

I haven’t really thought about it until this constant feeling of anger that I’ve been having the whole of today. Anger about everything. Especially anger about how reporting my sexual assault and trying to seek medical help for it has been so difficult (dismissing my assault to “it’s not rape / it’s consensual sex and this was just ‘roughness’ / closed your case since no offences were committed; being turned away from the GP and the A&amp;E that the GP referred me to; then being forced to pay nearly $600 for a forensic exam that I did not ask for, that would otherwise be free for sexual assault victims with a ‘police form’ which had not been given to me, a victim of penetrative sexual assault, because a male sexual crimes officer concluded that my experience was 100% consensual sex with a case of “roughness”)   — re-traumatising is putting it lightly. 

I actually started thinking it over and over (mainly because they were intrusive thoughts and i would get stuck in them, and here i am again) and trying to comprehend something so traumatic to me was seen as just “roughness” to the sexual crimes investigating officer who handled my case. They had to tell me, “this isn’t rape”. And I’ve been crying in bed figuring out how my situation was not rape, or even not considered sexual assault. 

Basically I’ve been meeting up with complete strangers for sex because I wanted to hurt myself. Dealing with an intense fear of when I get raped, complete hopelessness over my safety in this world, intense and uncharacteristic hypersexuality (with very dark and disturbing themes), and using sex as self-injury to cheapen myself further because I feel like I deserve it. I mean, just give the men what they’ve consistently shown me that they wanted, right?

14c0udv,[deleted]@3,relationship_advice,jojw5v9,t1_jojw2x6,4,[deleted],[removed],-71,1687064017,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/14c0udv/i_21f_found_a_spy_camera_in_my_room_after_my_step/jojw5v9/,FALSE,I (21F) found a spy camera in my room after my step dad (36M) put a surveillance camera in my window,katiedababie,"My stepdad (36M) installed a surveillance camera positioned outside of my window to scan our backyard while him and my mother and two younger brothers go camping. I couldn’t go on the trip since i had work, so i was staying home to house sit and feed our animals. My stepdad recently put up new cameras outside so I didn’t see anything wrong with him positioning one outside my window. Come to find out the very next day, I had my boyfriend stay over and he found that the surveillance camera that was ran from outside my window and into my room was being powered by one of those spy camera power blocks. 

For context, my relationship with my stepdad hasn’t always been the best and we tend to butt heads a lot. He’s said a lot of questionable things in the past that i’ve written off because he’s my dad and i would never think he intended to be inappropriate or harmful. He’s been in my life since i was 8 years old. Of course I’m second guessing everything now that i’ve found this camera. It was positioned to point directly at my bedroom door from the far wall, so it has direct view of my entire room, which i change in. 

I tried desperately to rationalize it and think it was maybe a mistake, like he grabbed the wrong charger box. Or maybe he was just trying to look for intruders. But really there is no excuse for putting a camera in MY bedroom. the camera even had an SD card in it. I’m beyond devastated. My stepdad even suggested i invite my boyfriend over to while they’re gone so i have someone here, which is something he would never do considering he’s made it clear before he doesn’t want him over when no one is home because he doesn’t want us ‘fucking in his home’. My boyfriend and I are going to go through the SD card to see if there is anything on it.

I’m at a complete loss at how to even bring this up to my mom. I confided in my aunt and uncle since they live close by and they have been very supportive of me having a conversation with my mom about it. This whole situation is extremely upsetting, I at least have some family to support me as i navigate this but i don’t even know how to bring this up to my mom. This is obviously going to change everything. She had my five year old half brother with him. 

My mind is racing with the consequences this is going to have on our family. Has anyone that has been in a similar situation have advice? How can i do this without causing extreme damage to the family (although that may be impossible). Thank you in advance.

TLDR; i found a hidden camera that my stepdad put in my room, how do i bring this up to my mom?

UPDATE(1/?):

I don’t want to make a whole new thread since i want to make a new update when my parents get back monday, but i want to thank everyone for all the advice. i went to the police station tonight and filed a police report and turned in the spy camera with the SD card. The officer said this is a serious offense and i will likely get a call early next week from an investigator due to the severity of the situation. I’m planning on telling my mother about the police report after we have a conversation about this on monday, with my aunt and uncle present. 

As for people messaging me about my profile: thank you for reminding me to delete personal information. Please please do not dox or try to seek any sort of justice for me as this may affect my case. Respect my privacy during this time please as it may be crucial during this investigation.

This was the hardest thing i ever had to do, but whatever this shit was, it’s ending with me. I hope i can get justice for myself and any other victims who may have been violated by him since this will be heavily investigated and the officer said it will likely be looked into further (such as search warrants and looking for more SD cards). i’m hanging on by a thread but the support i have is what’s keeping me together. i’m staying with my boyfriend tonight to keep out of the house. Thanks again for all the love and supportive messages. I’ll update again soon.

UPDATE (2/?)

it’s the next morning and once my boyfriend wakes up we’re going back to my house today to look for any more secret cameras (either in the bathroom or my brothers rooms) so i can submit it for more evidence. i’m iffy about searching my parents room for more evidence as it’s likely he has a hidden camera in there to see me do it. still on the fence about having a police officer search the house, if i do i’ll be sure to update after i’m finished and in a safe place. my aunt has offered to come with me to help me search.

again, thank you everyone for the support. i’m trying as best i can to do this the right way and get as much done with the time i have left. i’m mentally and emotionally drained but i’ll be seeking resources once all of this is said and done. i’m reading everyone’s comments so i’m taking all the advice i can get.

UPDATE (3/?)

i probably won’t be able to update for a few days since today is the day that i talk to my mom, but i just wanted to share the plan i made and hopes for what happens today.

after talking with my aunt, uncle, boyfriend, and my cousin who is a civil lawyer, i’ve decided that i will speak to my mom in a separate location from my stepdad. most likely i’ll have her meet me somewhere outside of our home. i’ll have my aunt with me and this is where i’ll explain everything to her: the camera, past uncomfortable experiences i’ve had with my stepdad that i originally brushed off because he was my dad, video footage of him deliberately setting it up and angling it, and footage of me in my room. im praying she understands why i had to go to my aunt instead of her considering she was not in town and i was worried for her safety if i told her what happened. (she was stuck with him and my brothers about 4 hours away for the weekend) 

i’m hoping with my aunt there and her being away from my stepdad that it’ll prevent her from reacting out of anger and search for him and escalate the situation then and there, and i hope my aunt can provide some support for myself and her. i’m prepared for her to go through the same processes i went through such as reasoning and denial, but with the evidence there’s no possible way she can deny it. i’m preparing myself for the worst. i just hope that i can be strong for her and support her as this all hits her like it did me. 

i will not be returning home or facing him today. my boyfriend will be on standby to pick up my brothers if needed since my aunt has offered for them to stay with us so my mom can talk to my stepdad without them there. i’ll ask my mom to meet me and of course, not tell my stepdad about the circumstances. maybe she can tell him she’s going to the grocery store. i don’t want him getting any hints that she could be meeting
with me. 

i know i’ve said it a lot but i truly do appreciate the support system i have not only with my family but here too. this has been a nightmare but hearing everyone’s stories about this, proving it’s way too common, is what is helping me get through this and pushing me to do the right thing. not only am i a victim in this but my boyfriend as well and god knows who else. the confrontation won’t happen for about another 7 hours so i’m the meantime i’ll be reading over comments and preparing myself for what comes today. thank you guys.","Original Post:

Title: I (21F) found a spy camera in my room after my step dad (36M) put a surveillance camera in my window
Body: My stepdad (36M) installed a surveillance camera positioned outside of my window to scan our backyard while him and my mother and two younger brothers go camping. I couldn’t go on the trip since i had work, so i was staying home to house sit and feed our animals. My stepdad recently put up new cameras outside so I didn’t see anything wrong with him positioning one outside my window. Come to find out the very next day, I had my boyfriend stay over and he found that the surveillance camera that was ran from outside my window and into my room was being powered by one of those spy camera power blocks. 

For context, my relationship with my stepdad hasn’t always been the best and we tend to butt heads a lot. He’s said a lot of questionable things in the past that i’ve written off because he’s my dad and i would never think he intended to be inappropriate or harmful. He’s been in my life since i was 8 years old. Of course I’m second guessing everything now that i’ve found this camera. It was positioned to point directly at my bedroom door from the far wall, so it has direct view of my entire room, which i change in. 

I tried desperately to rationalize it and think it was maybe a mistake, like he grabbed the wrong charger box. Or maybe he was just trying to look for intruders. But really there is no excuse for putting a camera in MY bedroom. the camera even had an SD card in it. I’m beyond devastated. My stepdad even suggested i invite my boyfriend over to while they’re gone so i have someone here, which is something he would never do considering he’s made it clear before he doesn’t want him over when no one is home because he doesn’t want us ‘fucking in his home’. My boyfriend and I are going to go through the SD card to see if there is anything on it.

I’m at a complete loss at how to even bring this up to my mom. I confided in my aunt and uncle since they live close by and they have been very supportive of me having a conversation with my mom about it. This whole situation is extremely upsetting, I at least have some family to support me as i navigate this but i don’t even know how to bring this up to my mom. This is obviously going to change everything. She had my five year old half brother with him. 

My mind is racing with the consequences this is going to have on our family. Has anyone that has been in a similar situation have advice? How can i do this without causing extreme damage to the family (although that may be impossible). Thank you in advance.

TLDR; i found a hidden camera that my stepdad put in my room, how do i bring this up to my mom?

UPDATE(1/?):

I don’t want to make a whole new thread since i want to make a new update when my parents get back monday, but i want to thank everyone for all the advice. i went to the police station tonight and filed a police report and turned in the spy camera with the SD card. The officer said this is a serious offense and i will likely get a call early next week from an investigator due to the severity of the situation. I’m planning on telling my mother about the police report after we have a conversation about this on monday, with my aunt and uncle present.

I'm a 20 year old male, now at university. This happened when I was 17.

I was never socially active as a teenager though I played sports and stuff, and a friend invited me to a house party. I didn't drink alot of alcohol or take any drugs, but when I was upstairs in the bathroom a girl started flirting with me. She was attractive and I vaguely knew her so I responded and we left to go in the garden. She was slightly drunk but I'm not sure.

Bear in mind I even then was well over 6 feet tall and 240 pounds, I do boxing and weight lifting, whereas she was about a foot smaller than me and half my size. We started kissing (which I hadn't done before) and she started touching my crotch. I wasn't comfortable with this and I asked her to stop. She laughed and didn't, so I moved her hand away lightly. She then shouted out that I ""touched her"".

I apologised, seeing as we were in the bushes at the top of the garden (about 100 yards long) and I didn't want a scene. It's sort of a blur now, but she basically said that if I didn't ""stop being a baby"" she'd tell everyone at the party I assaulted her.

The only way I can describe what happened next is when you get caught with a good shot in a spar and you're awake but ""in third person"". I know she pulled my trousers and pants down and started riding me, and I must have ejaculated at some point as I found I was sticky later. I had dried mud all over my butt as well.

She left and I just sat there for a while, then went home (not far to walk) in a daze. I remember running a shower and scrubbing the dirt off like a madman, and I went to sleep after.

I didn't report it or anything and for the next few months I didn't speak to her or see her again. I moved out of the area for university and haven't been back since.

But I'm just wondering now, is this a sexual assault? I must have been erect throughout it but I was a virgin and I definitely didn't consent to it, I was afraid of her saying I raped her or something horrible like that.

I plan to get therapy as this has given me a phobia of intimacy and I still haven't been in a relationship to this day","Original Post:

Even if you feel like it doesn’t affect you as much as you believe therapy warrants, it most likely affects you way more than your brain is letting you in on in order to protect you. Please go to a therapist, and it might be helpful to seek out one who specializes in male sexual assault. I hope everything gets better.

I was really weird as a kid. At like age 4-5 or maybe even younger, I was thinking about sex.

I would have crushes on boys at school, and think about having sex with them. As a VERY young child. I don’t think that’s normal. There’s a few other things that point to something happening to me as a kid as well.

Content: It's considered sexual assault as you were asleep and did not consent to him inserting his fingers.

Likely most guys would tell you that you're making a big deal out of it so it's suited to keep your mouth shut when around guys unless you want to be blamed (being drunk, sleeping around a guy, you didn't tell him no when you woke up so you consented) and shamed (if you weren't hanging around sluts you wouldn't be treated like one). 

It's suited to seek free hotline advice or counseling.

Content: I was diagnosed with PTSD a few years ago, and saw a therapist several times a week to deal with that and some other issues, although this particular incident was not brought up in therapy as there was a lot of other stuff going on that was at the forefront of my mind. Currently, I don't feel like I would even still fit the criteria for PTSD. I feel like my case was very mild in comparison to what many people experience, but I am aware of the symptoms and the likelihood that I could regress. 

I currently cannot afford to see a therapist outside of the ones at my school. I am in the process of looking into that, but we only get a certain amount of sessions per year, so we will see how that goes.

Content: What is mild in comparison: Your case of PTSD or your case of sexual assault? If the latter it's suited not to minimize your assault by comparing it to others. 

Perhaps you can contact a hotline for free therapy or support group counseling? Hope all goes well with your potential therapy.

Also thisnis important: it is not yours ( a child's ) responsibility to say no to being touched there by an adult. It's the adults responsibility to not touch you there no matter the circumstance.

I couldn’t go on the trip since i had work, so i was staying home to house sit and feed our animals. My stepdad recently put up new cameras outside so I didn’t see anything wrong with him positioning one outside my window. Come to find out the very next day, I had my boyfriend stay over and he found that the surveillance camera that was ran from outside my window and into my room was being powered by one of those spy camera power blocks. 

For context, my relationship with my stepdad hasn’t always been the best and we tend to butt heads a lot. He’s said a lot of questionable things in the past that i’ve written off because he’s my dad and i would never think he intended to be inappropriate or harmful. He’s been in my life since i was 8 years old. Of course I’m second guessing everything now that i’ve found this camera. It was positioned to point directly at my bedroom door from the far wall, so it has direct view of my entire room, which i change in. 

I tried desperately to rationalize it and think it was maybe a mistake, like he grabbed the wrong charger box. Or maybe he was just trying to look for intruders. But really there is no excuse for putting a camera in MY bedroom. the camera even had an SD card in it. I’m beyond devastated. My stepdad even suggested i invite my boyfriend over to while they’re gone so i have someone here, which is something he would never do considering he’s made it clear before he doesn’t want him over when no one is home because he doesn’t want us ‘fucking in his home’. My boyfriend and I are going to go through the SD card to see if there is anything on it.

I’m at a complete loss at how to even bring this up to my mom. I confided in my aunt and uncle since they live close by and they have been very supportive of me having a conversation with my mom about it. This whole situation is extremely upsetting, I at least have some family to support me as i navigate this but i don’t even know how to bring this up to my mom. This is obviously going to change everything. She had my five year old half brother with him. 

My mind is racing with the consequences this is going to have on our family. Has anyone that has been in a similar situation have advice? How can i do this without causing extreme damage to the family (although that may be impossible). Thank you in advance.

TLDR; i found a hidden camera that my stepdad put in my room, how do i bring this up to my mom?

UPDATE(1/?):

I don’t want to make a whole new thread since i want to make a new update when my parents get back monday, but i want to thank everyone for all the advice. i went to the police station tonight and filed a police report and turned in the spy camera with the SD card. The officer said this is a serious offense and i will likely get a call early next week from an investigator due to the severity of the situation. I’m planning on telling my mother about the police report after we have a conversation about this on monday, with my aunt and uncle present. 

As for people messaging me about my profile: thank you for reminding me to delete personal information. Please please do not dox or try to seek any sort of justice for me as this may affect my case. Respect my privacy during this time please as it may be crucial during this investigation.

This was the hardest thing i ever had to do, but whatever this shit was, it’s ending with me. I hope i can get justice for myself and any other victims who may have been violated by him since this will be heavily investigated and the officer said it will likely be looked into further (such as search warrants and looking for more SD cards). i’m hanging on by a thread but the support i have is what’s keeping me together. i’m staying with my boyfriend tonight to keep out of the house. Thanks again for all the love and supportive messages. I’ll update again soon.

UPDATE (2/?)

it’s the next morning and once my boyfriend wakes up we’re going back to my house today to look for any more secret cameras (either in the bathroom or my brothers rooms) so i can submit it for more evidence. i’m iffy about searching my parents room for more evidence as it’s likely he has a hidden camera in there to see me do it. still on the fence about having a police officer search the house, if i do i’ll be sure to update after i’m finished and in a safe place. my aunt has offered to come with me to help me search.

again, thank you everyone for the support. i’m trying as best i can to do this the right way and get as much done with the time i have left. i’m mentally and emotionally drained but i’ll be seeking resources once all of this is said and done. i’m reading everyone’s comments so i’m taking all the advice i can get.

UPDATE (3/?)

i probably won’t be able to update for a few days since today is the day that i talk to my mom, but i just wanted to share the plan i made and hopes for what happens today.

after talking with my aunt, uncle, boyfriend, and my cousin who is a civil lawyer, i’ve decided that i will speak to my mom in a separate location from my stepdad. most likely i’ll have her meet me somewhere outside of our home. i’ll have my aunt with me and this is where i’ll explain everything to her: the camera, past uncomfortable experiences i’ve had with my stepdad that i originally brushed off because he was my dad, video footage of him deliberately setting it up and angling it, and footage of me in my room. im praying she understands why i had to go to my aunt instead of her considering she was not in town and i was worried for her safety if i told her what happened. (she was stuck with him and my brothers about 4 hours away for the weekend) 

i’m hoping with my aunt there and her being away from my stepdad that it’ll prevent her from reacting out of anger and search for him and escalate the situation then and there, and i hope my aunt can provide some support for myself and her. i’m prepared for her to go through the same processes i went through such as reasoning and denial, but with the evidence there’s no possible way she can deny it. i’m preparing myself for the worst. i just hope that i can be strong for her and support her as this all hits her like it did me. 

i will not be returning home or facing him today. my boyfriend will be on standby to pick up my brothers if needed since my aunt has offered for them to stay with us so my mom can talk to my stepdad without them there. i’ll ask my mom to meet me and of course, not tell my stepdad about the circumstances. maybe she can tell him she’s going to the grocery store. i don’t want him getting any hints that she could be meeting
with me. 

i know i’ve said it a lot but i truly do appreciate the support system i have not only with my family but here too. this has been a nightmare but hearing everyone’s stories about this, proving it’s way too common, is what is helping me get through this and pushing me to do the right thing. not only am i a victim in this but my boyfriend as well and god knows who else. the confrontation won’t happen for about another 7 hours so i’m the meantime i’ll be reading over comments and preparing myself for what comes today. thank you guys.","Original Post:

He would try to take and spread embarrassing photos of me, consistently poke jokes at me, touch my stuff, and overall disrespect me.


One photo of me he spread was of me looking at my crush's insta profile, and it was badly timed. My eyes were closed and mouth was open, and it looked like I was jerking off. He laughed and said the whole school saw it.

I heard that he even spread rumors about me that I actually was jerking off, and actually convinced people that I was.

One time, i was on my laptop looking at a video called ""how to get a gf"". I minimized it to look at colleges. The kid came up to me, put his fingers on my keyboard, pulled up the video, laughed at me, and told some classmates in the same room what I was watching.

One day, I even felt very sad at one point (not depressed, just sad one morning, probably because I woke up on the wrong side of the bed, not at all related to him), that I looked up suicide on my laptop. The kid took a pic of me doing so and tried to spread it around. He laughed and said a quarter of the grade saw it.

In june, I impersonated him on reddit and made some awful posts insulting some classmates, and sent that impersonation account to 7 people to try to get it to spread.

I got even with him by defaming him online, giving out his first and last name, as well as saying lies about him bullying kids with Downs Syndrome and him being a pedophile and stuff like that. I basically pretended to be him writing those things, and some of those things are popping up in the Google Search if you look up his first and last name. I first did that back in June of 2020, before doing some in October, and finally doing some in December.

I posted a pic of him and pretending to be him, called him by his name, his state, and that he was a pervert.

Also in October, I ruined his reputation by telling everybody how much of a jerk he was to me, and told everyone to stay away from him because of how awful he is.

I had just learned last week that the kid had to go to see a doctor because after I made those posts about him, he lost weight, had trouble sleeping, and lost his appetite.

A lot of people who I talked to about this, including my parents, are telling me that what I have done was far worse than what he has done to me, because I caused him ""permanent damage"", but he did not cause me ""permanent damage"". They said something about how whatever goes on the internet does not fully go away, and that I should feel sorry and move on.

The kid told me to ""stop playing victim"" because I ""have gotten more than revenge"", since I have caused him ""permanent damage"".

Some people on Reddit are even telling me that I went too far.

It's gotten to the point where even my own parents are getting fed up of talking to me about it.

But for some weird reason, I keep ruminating on all the shit he said/did to me, and I can't help but feel very good about myself for all the trauma he is going through.

Sadly, some of the posts I made about him have been removed off of Google Search, but others are still sticking on there.

As a matter of fact, in my own head, I keep thinking that what HE did was worse, and that I should've doxed him even more to even things out with him.

I know it's very opinion-based, but do you side with me or my parents/the jerk/others on Reddit?

Comment (depth 1):
Author: snoogledoogle6
Content: Ok, idk if I mentioned everything.

I had a personal Reddit account on here that he hacked into and made a dirty post on, before showing it to some classmates in the same room as me.

He also had no concern for my wellbeing and even my life.

Could I argue that the number of shitty things he did to me are more than the number of shitty things i did to him?

Content: It doesn’t matter. He was an ass to you and you were an ass back. It doesn’t make you even, it just makes both of you assholes.

Comment (depth 3):
Author: snoogledoogle6
Content: But youre also saying that what ive done to him was worse than what he has done to me.

If the number of his offenses are greater than the number of mine, how is that true?

Comment (depth 4):
Author: [deleted]
Content: Your offenses were worse even if they were less numerous.

But what I’m actually saying is that it doesn’t matter. You shouldn’t be trying to get revenge. If someone has mistreated you then go to an authority figure and get him disciplined. Seek justice.

But since you settled for revenge now you are no different than the bully that bullied you.

Some guy I met briefly at dinner was next to me. He asked if I wanted to cuddle. I said yes. I thought were going to cuddle and go to sleep.

It was dark. We are spooning, and I feel his boner on my butt. I feel his hands moving. I thought he was uncomfortable at first but realized he was feeling me up. After a few mins I hear him whisper me his intentions. He whispered several more times. He keeps roaming his hands. It's hard to communicate because people are sleeping right next to us. Eventually after a few more mins he slips his hand into my panties and starts fingered me.

I was not expecting this in that situation.  People are asleep right right next to us, didn't want to wake them up. I touch his chin at one point as he is fingering me (I don't know why, I guess I just went along with it). Eventually I pull his hand off me. He whispers and asks what's up, I tell him I'm tired. He stops and we go to sleep.

I didn't know this guy's name, we literally just met.  He was a random guy.   I wasn't very attracted to him. I thought were just going to cuddle and sleep. Was this SA?  He did stop when I took his hand off. I also did touch his chin, so maybe he read that a certain way? But this bothers me because it was with basically a stranger and in a room full of people.
