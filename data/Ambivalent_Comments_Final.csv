As for what it is... no expert on (US i assume) legal things but I think what you're mainly asking about is how to process it emotionally, right?

For my own complex sexual history with a pushy dude I classified some things as dubious consent (freezing up, saying yes mid-thing bc it's easier, ...) and actual assaults for all things that happened after having explicitly stated I didnt want something.

I would recommend sorting through it and what you need with a professional though. 💖",2,False

Yeah I think because there’s so much to sift through it’s hard to make sense of it. It’s funny, before the break up I never let my mind even enter the idea of instances being sexual assault or that I wasn’t giving consent. I’ve been learning a lot and processing - as best I can. 

Writing down all the moments I can remember is definitely helping - and as you suggest, kind of making notes of what I define different things. For me that’s really helpful in organising the muddle and feelings!",1,True

Especially if it's all muddled, all the beliefs about yourself, him, what happened, who did what wrong, etc. It's tough to realize retroactively what happened &lt;3 If making categories, labelling experiences helps you in a way, then go wild. And if we're moving outside of the realm of law or using it as a basis to decide next steps, it's entirely up to you how you classify all those gray-zone things that could be either...

It wasn't with a dick, so it feels like it could've been worse. I also have ptsd from it, yet it's other people's reactions that I use to convince myself it was that bad: they noticed something was wrong with me, that I was off and not okay. I also still, seven years later, and three years after I realized it was SA, still don't want to accept that it was r-pe.

You're not alone. And yes, it was sexual assault (for showing you its genitalia at least, the rest is at minimum sexual harrassment if not SA) and also rape for your ex husband since you said no but he pushed past your lack of consent. I wanted to say it's completely normal to doubt yourself or be unsure, we tend to minimize what happened to us in a denial stage. What helped me was putting law definition on top of what I had lived, it help me realized that no, I wasn't exaggerating, the acts I was subjected to were forbidden by law and classed under SA.

Blacking out also is common, happened to me (blocked most of my memories of it until I was 16 and got my first boyfriend).

I can't advise anything for you to do, you have to find your own journey. Your first step is the right one, talking about what happened. And you should confide into irl friends too. Maybe some that would support you if you decide to go to the police. But I understand in cases of incest it's even more difficult, because of the reaction of your family. Do they know ? Do you think your parents would support you ?

11lre68,,0,johndavisjr7,"You're not imagining things!  This is VERY creepy behavior!  You did the right thing by reporting this!  Even if he's not grooming you, after MeToo, he should know better!  I'm a guy that has taught college (so the setting is a little different) and I could never imagine doing any of this, it's wildly inappropriate! 

If you haven't already, document everything you can remember, dates, times, locations, who else was there and begin doing it for everything else that happens in the future.  You have multiple witnesses to back you up.  If you doubt your feelings, remember the other people that were there with you that told you it was creepy or weird, that should tell you that you are right.  If nothing comes of this, press your school administrators and give them all the details, go higher than them if you need to.  If he's doing this to you he's probably done it to others in the past (and may have done worse) and if nobody stops him he will definitely do it in the future. The campus police at one campus where I taught sent an alert out after a couple incidents saying if these predators aren't stopped after these types of incidents they will feel emboldened to do more.

Finally, you mentioned this ""always happens to you"" and wondered why and that you are a victim if CSA.  There is abundant research that shows that as a victim of CSA you (and other victims) give off an insecure vibe (best way I can explain it) because of your history and the incidents that keep happening to you and these predators pick up on it, that's why it feels like it keeps happening to you, because it is!  I'd definitely recommend seeing a counselor about this, even a school counselor if you can't see any others.  They can help you deal with all of this.

One of the effects of childhood trauma can be a tendency to want to people please, and this delays learning to set boundaries. The good news is that it's possible to learn these skills. You're going to have a steeper learning curve than somebody who didn't have abuse in their background, so you may need some help from a professional such as a counsellor.

What you *deserve* is a safe environment to learn how to set and trust boundaries. That was not provided to you when it should have been, but now that you recognize that there's a need to do that, you have the opportunity to seek out help to make that safe environment for yourself.

It sounds like you're getting ready to take this to somebody like your school guidance counsellor, and from there the administration. What you've written here is very good. It's clear and concise, and it shows paths forward both for disciplining this teacher and for helping you to take your power back. Or maybe find your power in the first place.

10olxi4,,0,Pelm3shka,"Let's forget about your boyfriend, his feelings, pressure that could be on you at the time to be faithful to someone you were talking to but not dating yet, and focus on your feelings only for a moment.

You were drunk, quite sick even if you threw up. You did say you had no control over the situation. Being intoxicated is a common factor of not being able to give proper consent. Furthermore, he was much older than you (10 years). This is an additional factor of pressure.

But most importantly, how did you felt about it then, and how do you feel about it now ? Was he as drunk as you ? Did you feel he took advantage of you being drunk ? Did you wish at the time there was an easy way out for you to avoid that sexual contact ? Are you asking yourself this now because your current boyfriend might be upset if it was consensual and consider you cheated, or is he truly just helping you realize you didn't want any of this and you were putting guilt on yourself and hiding to yourself what happened wasn't consensual ?

There is something called enthusiastic consent. A constrained ""okay..."" is not consent. And it doesn't seem to me you were enthusiastic about it but rather felt pressured, and mostly weren't in a state in which you could give clear consent. I apologize in advance if my comment is harsh, I just want to help you think it through, because only you know first how you felt about it, and you seem unsure. I don't want to invalidate your feelings in any way, but I also don't want to victimize you.

The second thing is working on the memory itself, trying to transform how i integrate what happened to me into my life and my perception of what happened. What has not worked for me was trying to push it aside, swallow it or trying to act like nothing happened. As i said, the only thing that helped me was trying to transform the memory into something better and bearable, so that it does not pull me down each time come to think about what happened.

My mom knows, she didn't leave him when I was 11, and she still values keeping her house and garden and status quo more than my mental health.

The truth is, if your family knows but didn't go to the police nor decided to cut ties immediately, they are expecting you to not be an inconvenience and behave well and forget it, for _their_ sake. And it's not very likely to change if you do so

Nobody will stand up for you but yourself. But also, you are stronger than you think. Don't let this fucking piece of shit ruin your life nor future relationships, he's not worth it. If you are old enough, please go to the police before it's too late. You have to make your parents understand this is not going to slide, so they either get on the right side, or they decide to protect a rapist, but they can't do nothing and expect this to go away.

Also... It will get better. Please don't give up on yourself, this doesn't define you. I believe you. And I wish I could come and kick all their asses, and accompany you to the police station.

1lqqzco,,0,[deleted],"First of all, I'm really sorry about what you went through. No one deserves this. Secondly, there's really nothing wrong with you at all. What you're facing is probably what we all go through. Hypersexuality is often an aftermath of what we've been through.

1. When it comes to your mother, I think I can understand your situation. From my point of view, she should have been there for you instead of blaming it all on culture. I highly doubt there's any culture in the world which accepts assault like this. So it was definitely a wrong step and wrong justification from her. But at the end of the day I know she's your mother and you love her. So its natural to miss her. Though it does not make her right.

2. I cannot offer any legal advice as its not my position to do so. However, any sane person would say what you felt was not legal and not right. I'm sorry to be the one to confirm that yes it was indeed a sexual assault.

3. I'm sure that EU laws are strong. After ensuring your own safety, if you can then you can report it. Hopefully that will help avoid anyone else going through the same ordeal. But again, I'm no expert in laws and regulations and cannot offer any legal advice.

4. You're not narcissist, neither its mandatory for you to be with someone. Take your time to recover and heal. Make progress at your own pace. Don't feel pressured by anyone or anything.

1lqqzco,,0,Key_Animal_564,"1. What your mother did was terrible and detestible, but don't hate her. The best way to heal and move forward is to forgive her and let go of resentment for her. She can't be trusted with your well-being so I don't recommend getting close to her to ever become reliant on her, but acknowledge that she is your mother and remember the good things that she has done in your life if there is any good you appreciate in her. It isn't wrong that you miss her and it's good you still care for her just again, don't trust her to become reliant on her anymore. If you can take steps to let go of any hatred you harbor for her that will mean a lot for you to heal and move forward from the past trauma.

2. It was sexual abuse. The fact that it happened once was criminal 5 years is all the more justice that person deserves for his evil. Your mother is considered an accomplice for knowing it was going on and willingly allowing and enabling it to happen. I don't know the laws in your country, but both of them are guilty of the abuse you suffered. I don't think it will automatically get your mother in trouble to report it unless you intentionally share details about your mother's role in the abuse because she does bear responsibility, but it's up to you id you share those details. It is possible for you to only focus on charges against him if that is what you want to do.

3. I think you should report it. I believe he will still be prosecuted if you report it even if it happened in another country since he is an EU citizen. 

4. Traumatic and premature sexual experience has a deep effect on people especially at young ages. There was some damage done to your soul from the abuse you suffered and it pulled you to some unhealthy ways to cope. Your experience isn't uncommonly. Many people who are abused develope some unhealthy kinks that they don't want to have. Somehow it is your mind trying to bear with the trauma you faced. It is good to face your trauma and pain head on and seek to heal and that will help with those unhealthy pulls. I don't know of any kinds of psychiatrists to recommend, but I can say you should find people who can guide you in deep self reflection to face your past, accept that it happened, forgive those who wronged you and let go of the hurt and resentment so you can heal and move forward. It's not an easy process but finding someone who can help work with you through that kind of process is ideal.",3,False

1lqqzco,,0,Scorpios22,"Theirs nothing wrong with you. Hyper-sexuality is a common response to csa as is seeking to experience similar situations. From your story you experienced this situation for years and while im sure you hated it im also sure after a while you started to physically enjoy it, at least some of the time, that is what your body remembers and tries to drive you to repeat. 

I'm not a laywer so i wont comment on on wether this was legally rape or if you could get him in trouble. However it was, or at least would be in the U.S. 100% sexual assault. 

Missing your mother is also entirely normal. as to how you SHOULD feel about her thats really up to you. No one can tell you how you should feel, thats only for you to determine. 

Personally im pro-sex so i see no reason not to cam-model for a while if its a thing you think youll enjoy, it doesnt harm your mental health and you take reasonable safety precations. Make sure to do all that though and not just because you feel compelled to do it. Struggling with hypersexual desires is difficutly. I've definitly done things i shouldnt have because of that desire and you cant hate yourself when you fail.

You were a kid too, your body was responding naturally to the stimulus and that natural response was taken advantage of by someone older and more powerful. It was in no way, shape, or form your fault. 

Even if a child enjoys it, even if a child asks for it or initiates it, it is still 100% on the adult because children cannot consent.

With the little background you gave it doesn't seems that he did all for lure you into sex... More like his life situation was he dating a youg pretty womand and trying to form a home, and you dating a young handsome man trying to scape your uncles. He saw a way to give you a hand and you saw an opportunity of a new home and life.
Seems like he respected your desire to held off on sex and only when you brought up doing it because you live together and you could do that and he gladly accepted...

Till this point seems normal virgin/first/second or so love. It is little odd his condition or expecting sex or meal, but most men in the world are much worse than that... So... Not good, not terrible.
You made it, the first always hurts but he was caring and ultimately you both enjoyed.... The neighbor thing simply other stupidity of him feeling like alpha male (not great not terrible) and the neighbor never heard those sounds from his apartment so out of dirty curiosity he approached to ask...

Again, i dont know his nor your age, dont know how you meet, dont know how long did you known each other.... With what i could read seems pretty normal, a little not good in some aspects but none is perfect, we can always change (if we talk about this things), and you can always leave if you dont like something or better yet talk it, say it, explain it to your partner.

If its any more information about this that might renforce your feelings of being abused bring them up so te community can help you more. Maybe i'm missing or not understanding something.

ml3n16,,0,brokengirl89,"Being drunk in and of itself means that you are unable to give consent to sexual activity. I know plenty of people have “consensual” sex while drunk, I’ve done it myself, but legally it’s not because of things like this. Especially since you can’t remember what your response was when asked to try anal. The fact that you were so drunk that you were unable to communicate your fear and distress means that you were definitely too drunk to be having sex, and honestly there are some huge red flags that your ex orchestrated it on purpose (him not being as drunk as you, knowing that anal was a hard no, knowing that you were far too drunk to resist). The fact that you said to him multiple times that it hurt and asking for help is the real kicker here, because it doesn’t matter what happened up until that point, whether you were drunk or not, or whether you had consented. Consent to any sexual activity can be withdrawn AT ANY TIME. This was clearly you withdrawing your consent (or pseudo-consent in this situation) and wanting the activity to stop, of which he purposefully ignored you and the fact that you were clearly in pain did not stop him because “it felt really good” to him. This was a selfish act and completely violated your rights to your own body and your trust, and is without a doubt sexual abuse/assault. I know that you believe that he never meant to hurt you, I understand this mindset well, but I invite you to let go of this thought because if he truly didn’t mean to hurt or harm you in any way he would not have continued when he knew you were in pain. He was being selfish. And I’m so sorry that this happened to you. The fact that these memories are bothering you means that you should think about talking to some kind of professional about them, even if that just means texting or calling a SA hotline to ask their opinion. It can be very helpful to hear other people validating how you feel about these experiences. Just know that all of your emotions are valid x",1,False

liv51f,,0,[deleted],"I'm so sorry your uncle treated you the way you did.

First of all, his conduct is *absolutely* sexual assault. You should feel no obligation to equivocate or make excuses on this point. His behavior was predatory and exploitative. And your family's failure to support you is shameful. I'm truly sorry you aren't being heard and recognized.

However, while your aversion to sex is understandable, the greater tragedy here is that you've been left with such obstacles to achieving intimacy. This is hard for all of us, of course, and I struggle with it myself, but ultimately it's among life's most worthwhile experiences. Getting there for people with our background is often challenging, but I hope you can find the support needed to start working your way there. You deserve to be able to enjoy love and connection, and whatever degree of sexuality that entails. Sex isn't the most important thing in life, but love might be.

I have experienced many of the things you are now, five years ago when I was 14. After having five years to heal, here is what I will tell you. Time will heal, I know that doesn’t help you to hear now, but I want you to know that the nightmares and the panic will become less intense over time and eventually go away. 
It will be important to address your trauma but that is after your mental health is stable once again. 
I’m not sure if your school was made aware of the situation since you mentioned the police were but I would send your teachers an email, I know it seems extremely intimidating but the sooner you address it, the easier it will be. You are not a failure at all. I hope you can give yourself love and grace, because you needed to give yourself some time. 
Maybe making a check list of the things you need to do for the day could help. It can help you to feel more accomplished and motivated. 
Could you order groceries online and have them delivered? and maybe get some food that’s easy to prepare while you are still healing. 
I’m sorry your friends haven’t supported you in the way that you have needed. It’s invalidating for a friend to bring up their issues while talking about yours and it’s important for a friend to listen. 
I’d imagine a lot of things feel out of control right now, but when someone self harms, they are in control, and that’s what makes it more tempting. 
I know you mentioned you don’t like therapy but I did EMDR therapy, and it’s a process of revisiting and healing from the situation. It sucked going through it but it honestly changed my life so I just wanted to put it out there.

This principal has an incentive to downplay it. If schools do the right thing, it then gets added to the statistics. People just look at the number of crimes that happen at a school, not how it was dealt with.

Which would you go to? A school that had 5 rapes in the last year or one with 0? Now find out that those 5 rapes resulted in expulsion and charges against the rapists and the other school just wiggled out of reporting the same number of rapes. People just look at the raw score.

The second one is rape. You said no, he clearly ignored it.

As for being wet, that is a physical response to sex or the knowledge sex is coming. When you have desire to have sex with someone it can happen. If your brain recognizes it coming, it also can happen as a method of protection, not desire. I know that desire can cause but this has people confused and they assume it is always desire. A lot of women get wet as their body is trying to prevent damage. Also, fear can be confused by the body as arousal resulting in wetness and even orgasms that were unwanted.

SA by women is not taken seriously because the stereotype for women is that they are not as sexual and that they are non violent and kind. This DOES however affect the behavior of many women who conform to these standards, cause the point of these social constructs is to indoctrinate people to follow them. Therefore, on average, women who assault others will do so less violently. Also, many women who have these urges will resist them entirely, because they've been taught to resist even HEALTHY sexual urges.

Meanwhile many men are quite literally taught to mistreat and disrespect women as well as to be violent and selfish, in subtle ways most of the time, but it adds up. I think the difference between the demographics is clear and importantly it can entirely be explained by societal influence and nurture, not pseudoscience like evolutionary psychology.

Overall I do think the biggest difference is the severity of the assault and the methods used to restrict/coerce the victim, leading to underreporting.

1n3pk33,,0,MaxQ1080p,"I’m sorry this happened to you. The feelings and fantasies you are having are very common for sexual abuse victims. 

I experienced very similar things after I was violently raped. I thought I was going insane.  Like, why would I have such a strong desire to have it happen again??? I was not as young as you were. I was in my early 20s and still I had the same feelings. It got to the point I was actually putting myself in very dangerous situations with men I knew wouldn’t respect me or my boundaries.  

After a few years of this, I couldn’t live like that anymore and found a wonderful psychologist who specialized in helping sexual assault and abuse victims get themselves to a healthier and happier place. I don’t know your situation, but if it’s possible, I highly recommend talk therapy with a psychologist. They are there to help. And, you make the most progress when you find one you are comfortable enough to talk about your most delicate thoughts, feelings and reactions.  For me, my most shameful thing was that during this most violent assault, I orgasmed. That broke my brain. Like, how could I have such an intense orgasm during the worst thing that ever happened to me. My psychologist told me it’s normal and it was my body involuntarily reacting to stimuli, like a sneeze. Knowing that, helped me so much. 

There is a best selling book called, “The Body Keeps the Score” which helps you understand why your body seems to crave the trauma and offers proven methods to rewire your brain - the same methods top athletes use to improve their performance.  It’s on Amazon for about $11 USD.

A few things you need to know - 
- none of it was your fault, even the times you feel you initiated it. Children are very easily manipulated.
- It’s unfair to that little girl who went through all that to judge her with your adult brain. Her brain wasn’t developed enough to comprehend what was happening nor to have a defense. This is why there are laws protecting children.  Again, children are very easily manipulated.
- It’s not your job to keep his secret. Keeping this all to yourself (not telling anyone in your family or close circle) is causing you great mental anguish. If you need help talking with your family about this, a close friend actually had her psychologist invite them to her office and helped my friend tell her parents what happened in a safe place where her psychologist could help her parents with their reaction.  It worked out very well for her.
- What happened to you doesn’t define you or your future. 

I wish you strength and happiness. ❤️",2,False

I'll try to do what you recommended and seek help. I think I'm just putting off something I should have done already. I think it's my way of punishing myself for having these thoughts.

I don't know if I can be strong enough to report it or talk to anyone in my family about it; it's been so long, and in my mind, they'll think I'm making it up for taking so long to tell them.

It's normal but you would also get way more attachment from someone you cuddled and kissed consentually.

Unwanted oral performed by mouth on genitals or anus is classified as aggravated sodomy. (Yes I read that three times when I saw it)

And let say it go that far, sexual touching without consent is sexual assault. Even if you got an erection and orgasmed from it, that is not proof of consent. (I read some rapists like forcing victims into arousal or orgasm to confuse them.)

The thing is, even people who have it worse are already ignored because of some ""technicality"".

I do not wish to repeat it so I guess look through my posts here or r/MenGetRapedToo if you're curious enough about what happened, but I will mention a major ass detail is that I revoked consent, and he overpowered me and continued against my will, and yet it still feels like it's not valid because I initially consented, despite the fact that I revoked it.

Take the rubbing. He rubbed on you, you say stop, he wants sex, you say no and stop groping, These are sexual assaults right there. You gave in because he was assaulting you so that does sound like coercion. Coercion is a consent but given under duress. So I agree with your therapist.",3,False

If she penetrated you against your will that is many states classifies it as R (can be an inanimate object). Without it, touching sexual areas it is sexual assault. I am sorry she was your best friend those betrayals hurt the most. 

Second case. In states where consent laws are, many of them says verbal or non verbal consent with the latter having to be a positive consent. Something like you initiating parts of it. There are no negative consents. So, not saying no is not saying yes. People freeze and are even unable to talk in some cases and they can not say no because they can't say a thing. So that is R. Probably considered date R, still just as valid.

Last time, you kept saying no. Beyond a point that starts becoming coercion. So, you said you gave up, This time it not the last. You did say no, he refused to accept it. So, I am not sure 100% what you did so here are the options. 

You stopped saying no and again did nothing and let he do what he wanted to do. Well, you said no before this and capitulation from coercion is not consent. This would be R.

Lets give the other scenario to an extreme beyond what it probably went. Les say after constant pushing and him fusing to accept it, even if that this point you took a positive role such as undressing yourself, it still would be R as you said you were scared so this would have been R by coercion. A person can't keep refusing to accept a no continuously until someone says yes. Again, even in this extreme, it is R.

The only thing is the first one could by legal definitions not be R but it would be sexual assault which is still just as bad.

So, no, you are not overreacting. Now as far as blaming those, yes can and in my opinion should blame them. All three cases are at least sexual assault and are very wrong.",2,False

1hcx827,,0,[deleted],"So you were raped. FRIES is a good acronym to think about consent, and sort out exactly why it's rape. 

F - Freely given. So NO your consent was not freely given, because he never fucking asked for consent. 

R - Reversable. You felt like you couldn't say no because of his abusive behaviour. 

I - Informed (e.g. if I consent to sex with someone without a condom, but they don't tell me they have an STD, my consent isn't informed consent, therefore the interaction isn't consensual). 

E - Enthusiastic!  You don't have to be leaping around for joy, you can feel nervous and be nervous, but also just lying there silently so clearly isn't enthusiasm. 

S - Specific. I.e. if I consent to kissing, this doesn't mean I consent to someone touching my breast. 

As you can see, your boyfriend ignored a number of these markers. Your consent wasn't freely given because he never gave you the opportunity to say no. Your consent wasn't enthusiastic, you were literally frozen up. During the 'consensual' sex you had, he tried anal sex which you didn't consent to ('specific'), so that was also assault.

1fpd8ot,[deleted]@1,2,[deleted],You were asleep. You didnt give consent either. Thats still rape/ sa,1,False
1fpd8ot,,0,Physical_Song3275,"There's no question you experienced SA.  And your situation is exactly why laws around age of consent exist.

You have to remember that humans have evolved to procreate - to be aroused, to have sex.  It's why our species continues, and it's fundamentally biological in nature.

And when I say biological, that includes the psychological responses of your brain to sexual stimulus.  It's not something that you can deny or control - any more than you can stop your heart racing when you're frightened.

Adolescence can be an incredibly confusing period.  You're on the path to become an adult, and a part of that is progressing towards sexual maturity.  Like essentially every adolescent who has ever lived, you will inevitably experience sexual curiosity and arousal.  And there are peer pressures and societal expectations to navigate.

The laws around age of consent are specifically there to ensure that children and adolescents are not exploited during this vulnerable and confusing period.  Because the evidence of the harm that such exploitation causes to the victims is very, very well established.

Essentially, the law says that, because of your vulnerability due to your age, you're not even legally able to provide consent.  So it wasn't on you to say you didn't like it, or to explicitly say no.  The law says you did experience SA, and the law is 100% correct.

It's important to add that the fact that you may have gone along with what was happening, or even experienced a degree of curiosity or excitement, are exactly the reasons why these laws exist.  Because - like I said at the beginning - these are, at their core, biological responses that you can't stop that make you vulnerable.

You mustn't allow yourself to feel guilty about this, but it's incredibly difficult not to. The shame can be almost tangible.  Please don't underestimate the damage that's been caused and remain silent and bottled up - it's so important you speak with someone you trust very soon, so that you can begin to give a voice to how you're feeling and to work through this awful situation you've been put in - a situation that is entirely, 100%, not your fault.

Like others here, I also wish you good luck also I'm so sorry you've had to experience this, and must now deal with it.

But I'm very glad you reached out like you have. It's a brave, important first step, and you should be very proud that you have.",2,False
1fpd8ot,Physical_Song3275@0,1,[deleted],"hey, i didnt realise ppl would actually reply and give advice. first of all, thank you SO MUCH for takin the time to reply, i actually decided to follow your advice and confided in a friend first and they referred me to an NGO counselling, and ive signed up. thanks a lot again.

but the thing is, even though you say it's normal to feel guilt, i feel it mainly because he mightve thought i was okay w it or that i somehow might have lead him on in a way, yk. because i couldve 100% stopped it, i had the power, yet i froze. everytime i think bout it i feel like i let myself down. but i rlly hope counselling helps. 

also, the fact that he's actually really close to me is what makes everything a 100 times more difficult. like if he was some rando creep family friend id have out him and watch him face the consequences but since im rlly rlly close w him, i jus cant. also, it's been so long since it started, (when i was in elementary school i think, but it rlly peaked during middle school) so idt ppl would believe me.

anyhow, i rlly appreciate you taking your time helping me❤️❤️",1,False
1fpd8ot,,0,MikkiFaith2024,"You said in a couple of comments that you didn't express disinterest. Regardless of saying ""Yes"" or ""No"" to it, incest is illegal and automatically sexual assault. You need to go to the police as soon as possible. I understand that you may not feel comfortable telling your parents. I didn't when I was raped for over 2 years straight. but you need to tell someone. take it from someone who knows. If you bottle it up, it's going to affect you much worse later on. 

My rapist started a month after I turned 9 and didn't stop until I was halfway through 11. I'm 20 now. up until I was 18, I never told a soul. I didn't write about it in my journal, I didn't tell my foster mom about it, I didn't tell any friends or teachers/counselors at school, no one. Even after.i got out of foster care (not going into why I was in it, don't bother asking, sorry) I never even told my bio mom or stepdad, or even my sister. My sister still doesn't know. My mom and stepdad only know a portion of what happened to me. I've never told them in detail. I still haven't told my boyfriend of over a year about what happened, at least not in detail. 

I kept it bottled up until I was 18 and in the hospital for suicide watch. I told my work bestie/crush at the time one night while I was in the hospital. I just couldn't hold it in anymore. I needed to tell someone. I didn't tell my parents until nearly 6 months after the suicide watch incident. 

now, I'm much more open about it but I am 100% still uncomfortable with the thought of it. I still feel disgust. I still have no interest in sex. I've never even felt sexual attraction. 

In addition to my young childhood rapes, I was also raped at 17. 2 or 3 times. The first time is only suspected. I had those same ""symptoms"" that I had when my foster dad raped me. Pain in the vaginal area, bleeding, nausea/vomiting. the other two, I remember them like they were yesterday. Both the young childhood and the teen incidents affect me majorly even to this day. 

The one thing I can say is that while it still affects me now, it's much easier to cope with now that I have people to talk about it with. Tell someone you know. Someone.

but i dont think i will ever get the courage to tell someone from family or the authorities because if you take that off the equation, he's actually a rlly nice person and i care about him. cuz if it was some rando creep, id tell authorirtiess and watch him face the consequences. but it's not. and thats what makes it so damn impossible for me to tll family. and he's the typa guy everyone naturally loves being around.

My sister had my brother arrested when he was 17 for this exact thing.

You may never expect how. I never expected my brother to give a confession to a cop over basically a burger king meal, but apparantly he did.

 You can threaten him to tell people if he were to try anything again if youre still hestitant about actually doing so. I bet you could reverse the ""power dynamic"" quite quick if you did this. I think it may be a consideration to make people aware though.

  Lets be clear, you could not consent to this, you couldnt because you were too young and that should be the end of the consideration of consent. Im sorry this has happened to you.

I do not think this is happening because of his adhd at all. My partner has adhd and one could say it's a pretty strong case, plus they're also hypersexual whereas i'm quite the opposite. Still, what happens between us it 100% consensual and they respect every ""no"" i give and every boundary i have put up.

Thank you very much for your support and message it's much appreciated. 
I definitely do not accept to be the collateral damage of his adhd and that's why there is a big problem right now, and i don't think i can continue this relationship especially when he is having this type of behaviour and is so lost. 

I think his poor reaction shows that he has actually done nothing no matter what he thinks. I have been ""begging"" for him to start therapy again because he is definitely not managing his adhd, the problem is that he is struggling so much that going to see a therapist seems like too much and he can't even visualise adding it to his plate... He is taking shrooms, trying to work on himself, following stuff on YouTube and Reddit ... But this is clearly not working, he has definitely not faced anything he has done, can't even talk about it without making it about himself because he is full of guilt and shame.

If they don't care enough to listen to their partners verbal communications during sex, that's not just hyper focus. It can be partially, but he should absolutely care enough about you to listen to you, ESPECIALLY during sexual things. 

Similarly, if the first time it happened was truly a hyperfocus problem, which I doubt but maybe it was. Then ANYTIME after that he should be paying WAY more attention. If it actually traumatized him as much as he claims, he'd NEVER do it again. But he has. That's not just hyperfocus, he doesn't care enough to pay attention when HE KNOWS it's a problem.

But i swear many times i have said no in the middle and he stopped all the time right away (except those times and they are unerasable), that he is not at all interested in rape and i believe that

Sadly i really think that it was traumatic for him, that he really care, that he knows deep down it wasn't right, but he can't face it so his brain completely shut down like PTSD if not PTSD, and he doesn't can't face anything, he shuts down everything any empathy towards me ...

Instead of taking control over you in a predatory manner he should have talked about that beforehand and even during act when (If) you both have consented should be asking you “are you comfortable doing this? Do you want us to take it further?”. He took advantage of you and thats definitely a sexual assault/rape. Kissing back in a situation like that when you have literally no words is not a consent, its just reaction coming from fear and confusion. Disgusting behavior from him. I would not believe any word he will say now. He’s gonna try and be manipulative and act like he did not know you were not comfortable with that. Don’t trust someone like that, pls",6,False
160rc85,Citizen-2000@0,1,toadstooltipping,Thank you. He keeps trying to ask me to hang out again says he'll never touch me but I don't trust it that's what I thought the first time. He's like I didn't understand. He knew or he's mentally retarded but he doesn't seem mentally retarded otherwise. He says he wants to be a real friend I need that he meant everything he said he didn't know. I was completely dissociating for a week I haven't been able to be normal since it so disgusting.,3,True
160rc85,Citizen-2000@0,1,toadstooltipping,He keeps saying he didn't know and he wants to be friends he wants to show me he can be a real friend without touching me. I haven't been okay. I disassociated for a week and he had done other stuff I felt trapped and then he stopped when I was crying and said he didn't know that he really thought I was into him he wouldn't touch someone not into him. I asked when he got the impression I was into him I never touched him I never went to touch him he wouldn't stop. After that he was still hugging me he said he wouldn't do anything sexual. But then he tried to say oh I'm still here if you want me we could still do other stuff if you want we don't have to have sex we can shower together or just kiss. I didn't want any of it. It's horrible. He knew my birthday was coming up and was like come hang out I'll buy you some cheesecake I won't do anything I promise you don't have to worry I know now.,3,True
160rc85,toadstooltipping@1,2,Citizen-2000,"How he wants you to be with you and around you all the time and how pushy he seems, there is no way he did not know what he was doing. He knows exactly what he did, and now this new agenda “oh, i can be your real friend, i promise” is just straight up BS. Its clear how he tries to be soft spoken and sorry when its just a manipulation to make you feel sorry for him and nothing else. Even after what he did he tries to make YOU feel sorry for him and make you forgave him, which is absolutely unthinkable and disgusting behavior. Those sorries does not mean sh*t. I’m really really sorry for this experience, it’s extremely disappointing when it’s coming from someone you thought you were friends. There is no way you can be friends after that. Let’s say he “changed”, which i won’t ever believe, that experience is still there, in your heart, you will never be as free and comfortable with him ever (and you should NOT be). You could file a report but without physical evidence it will be hard to do sth, idk how Judgement works in USA in those kind of situations. If it’s possible cut him off from your life. If you got friends/family to talk about it more, it should be easier to get over it and start healing from it. I’m glad you were brave and posted your story. Remember your feelings are always valid and real. Nobody has any right to overpower them and say they are not real, especially people like him.

He said we only kissed out on the couch and he asked to take it to the bedroom. BS he pulled my shorts off immediately. And then other things that weren't what happened. When I called him he was like I was thinking of you I even bought a piece of cheesecake and sent me a picture of it which is weird right?

160rc85,Citizen-2000@4,5,toadstooltipping,"Yeah he didn't seem to be upset or ""care"" . Every call he kept saying that's not how it happened it wasn't like that. He gave me some reaction I had to use antibiotic cream for it was awful and he's like oh you're going to throw me away for that I didn't mean to I'm not walking around giving diseases. If other people hadn't raped you then it wouldn't have happened you would have spoken up it's not my fault you dissociate you would have pushed me off. He's huge comparatively. He said he didn't tie me down he wasn't violent. He didn't force me? He picked me up and moved my body. He pulled my shorts off and spread my legs there was no force then how did that happen? He said I shouldn't have had him there if I was afraid of him, after telling me he just wanted to hang out as friends, we didn't have to have sex, and he said before that he wasn't going to make a move on me. I felt like he broke me. 

   I don't know what to do. Even my aunt said not to go to police because I've been there before and they're not going to take me seriously.

I think filing a report is always a right choice if you are willing to do it and have strength to do it, of course. Don't listen to people who were not on your side and did nothing when you were right and you needed help (your aunt in this situation). There is always a chance they take your case seriously and maybe follow with some actions. It's gonna be hard because there is no physical evidence of this but maybe you filing a report might help others and prevent any abuse toward other girls. Perpetrator should always be known, it makes them more fearful and they will be more content with their actions ofc if they don't wanna be put in jail. Be away from him ofc but if you ever be in a situation where he might have some bad intentions towards you have a phone ready to record sth to have some evidence, i hope it will never happen but it might help the case.

He could have done a lot better.  He could have, built up the anticipation of your intimacy, talked you through it, engaged in more foreplay, used lube, and cuddled afterward.

11gk3w1,Wild_Following_7475@0,1,Ruffygummy,"What the actual f? Of course it was, but maybe our views just go very far apart. Coercion, sexual assault, and yes, rape. OP reached back to stop him, because stopping someone verbally can be very difficult.
He didn’t care, and continued. Another Reddit user had about 10 parts of consent, and if only one is missing it’s at least coercion, and after that I believe it’s sexual assault, at least. Basically, consent goes as far as what was agreed upon before starting being intimate. There’s no value to things agreed to while already active, cuz the mind is cloudy and you’re not able to think clearly, hence coercion. There are things that do make an impact while in the situation though, which is withdrawing consent. Things you thought you were okay with or wanted before, but then when it actually was about to happen, maybe you misjudged what your feelings would be in that moment? Maybe the situation as a whole was not like you’d want it to continue like you thought it would’ve.

Bottom line, you can do less, not more than what was agreed upon.
And if you do find yourself wanting to do something, you’ll also want to the next time and you can talk about it when not physically aroused.

There were boundaries overstepped, your wishes, also non-verbal were ignored, and if you ask me, that was rape, sexual assault, and if none of that, at the least coercion, which also makes it sexual assault.

What he did was not okay, and you don’t have to verbally tell him to stop.

115hy9e,,0,Lunatic_Jane,"You cannot compare your trauma against others trauma, just as they cannot compare theirs to yours. Its an impossible comparison. And it doesn't matter what title you use to describe an experience, what matters is if it felt like an assault against your self. You are the person affected, and you should never deny the felt experience. To do so, is self abandonment. Your validation is the only one that truly matters. Your therapist has already validated this for you, and you are still looking for further validation, and this is because you have yet to connect it for yourself. 

Our body language is even more powerful then our words. Anyone who says they can't tell when someone is not consenting or into it, is a liar. Stop blaming yourself because you were too  frightened to say no. We don't have any control over our fight/flight/freeze response when we are having a traumatic experience. Our brain computes the best possible response that will increase the odds of survival without our permission. 

Losing love is a traumatic experience in itself. And its not surprising for someone who didn't receive it in their developmental years to later put themselves in compromising positions in order to obtain or maintain it. I do suggest that you work through your childhood traumas, so that you can regain your natural self protection. Because unaddressed trauma makes sure that history repeats itself.  We will continue to put ourselves in situations to find resolution to our past traumas. That isn't an at fault statement, that is just how the human brain is wired. We all do this at some level. Some people will avoid sex, while others may repeatedly reenact the assault with future partners. But both will suffer as a result. 

The bottom line is that if these interactions weren't personally an assault against you, you wouldn't give it a second thought. And that is enough to validate it as such.",13,False

2. Yes. Oral rape, at the very least.

3. Yes. Furious, for a start.

4. I'm not a lawyer, but my guess is that a prosecutor is unlikely to prosecute this under the category of statutory rape. In California, several other charges are possible, including (in descending order of gravity) forcible acts of sexual penetration, oral copulation, or sexual battery.",1,False

What country do you live in? 

Your father is Sexually Assaulting you. This is 100% child abuse. I'm so sorry you're in this situation, both your parents are being horrible. 

Your mother should have contacted the police and gotten you away from your father the second you told her. By allowing this abuse to continue, your mother is also participating in child abuse.

You need to therapy to in order to make yourself able to heal about what happened and how to protect yourself from situations like these. And under no circumstances, will you ever attempt to take your life.

You're still beautiful. I won't say forget your past but learn from it. Let it be your guidance for your future not the reason of your fall. Please without therapy you can't learn to move on or heal and learn to avoid situations where predators are waiting to prey on you.

Lastly try to focus on completing your school and getting a degree. Make a future and keep your focus on that. Go on journey of self-discovery and learn about your likes and dislike, for example your hobbies. Apart from completing education, learn to keep yourself busy with your hobbies.

I'm not at all saying that it would be easy. It would be hard and rocky road but you can cross it. I hope you understand that working on yourself can help you achieve happiness in life.

zs6o78,,0,Andyman1973,"None of it was/is your fault. None. 

Sometimes I consider how “lucky” I was, that I dissociated through much of my childhood trauma. I was 2.5yrs old when mine started. By age 5/6 I stopped trying to tell my parents. It just got me in trouble anyway.  Sure, dissociating kept me safe in the moment, but not having access to those memories kept me from recognizing any potential dangers. Nearly all csa/r traumas happened outside of the home. Non-csa abuse was happening at home anyway.

It didn’t stop once I became an adult and joined the Marines. My 1st adult relationship turned out to be coerced sa, with an older woman. There were others too. 

The topper was marrying a woman very much like mommy dearest. You know that old trope about marrying someone like our parents, good bad or ugly. It’s what we know, what we’re familiar with. Growing up, I had no honest idea I was being abused. It was my normal.  Eighteen years later, those trauma memories started coming back. Left ex within a year of the first memory returning. I’m 5 years out now. 

There’s more, so so much more. While I cannot know/understand what you been through, I definitely understand and know the after effects. But then again, I also don’t, per se. Since I was a toddler when my journey started, some of those normal things we develop, as young children (3-6yrs), never really did, for me.  

The most important thing I can share with you, regarding your future is this: self care, it’s the most important kind of care there is. And it’s widely/openly talked about, except in mental health contexts(after MH issues arise, not before). Be gentle with yourself, there’s no easy/quick fix for us survivors. It will be with us for the rest of our lives. Also, regarding relationships, you do NOT ever have to put up with anything, because of any reason. You absolutely DO deserve to be treated with dignity, respect, and loving kindness.  That’s all. Now if I could just remember these things for myself, I might make it, lol.",2,False

ylclm7,,0,TheGus_,"Well this is intersting.

You were assaulted, this goes without saying. Even if you did enjoy it, it's still assault.

And this is the tricky part regarding assault or rape. Sometimes people enjoy it, or more accurately, are groomed into thinking they enjoy it, and sometimes they even get wet or have an orgasm. The latter is pure biology, but it still consfuses women and they end up thinking that they might have enjoyed it, and that destroys their psyche. 


My take is that because of your kink, you took a risk letting it happen, and the aftermath means that you didn't enjoy this kink with this person in particular.
Of course that's ok and you have every right to.

But the moment you have any doubts about anything, and in this case you have plenty, it's not ""well since i've had sex with him already, i must have enjoyed the assault as well"".

And when you throw real friendship and love into the mix, it makes things immensely complicated. Hence the panic attacks. Your body is stressed beyond what it can handle.

I know this doesn't help at all, but i hope everything turns out ok for you.",2,False

vpca35,,0,Available_Gap1316,"I just want to let you know that something EXTREMELY similar happened to me. I dated someone for a year. Almost every single time he pressured me into having unprotected sex, often under the guise of “just for a little” or “i won’t go all the way in” or “it doesn’t feel good with it on”. If I said we had to wear a condom he didn’t want to have sex anymore so I went along with it sometimes. One time we had sex with a condom and I noticed after that he had taken the condom off without me knowing. I was mildly upset in the moment, but after a few minutes I carried on like nothing happened.  This was early in our relationship and we continued to date for a long while. Sex became transactional, it didn’t matter if I said no, I’d be pestered and ignored until I just laid there and let him. He often would be behind me and finish on me and I would say “you were wearing that until you pulled out, took it off and came right?” and he would say yes every time. Towards the end, he confessed to me that every single time we had ever had sex with a condom, which was many times, he had taken it off without me knowing. I was upset for a minute, but we dated for at least 3 more months. At one point I likely fell pregnant and miscarried early, looking back at it now.

It did not feel like assault. It did not feel like rape. He was gentle, I loved him, he loved me, and was never aggressive or violent. We broke up later for unrelated reasons. I did not think about it for a long time because it didn’t particularly disturb me. Years later I learned about stealthing, then I spoke to therapists who told me I was assaulted. It has been almost 5 years and I think about what happened to me almost every day.

You are not crazy and you are not disgusting. If you are, then I was too. But I want to let you know that this behavior will continue with him and it will likely get worse. Someone who likes or loves you would not violate you. I think you should ditch this guy. I wish someone had told me this after the first few times.",2,False

I just don’t know what to do, no advice, no push or something of significance. I’m sorry if I just put things out, I’ve been trying to sleep but just been crying over and over, remembering things I can’t unsee atm. I remember in March 2020, when I met Alyssa it was the second day we met, I only use this one statement when ik I feel something right, I said to her that something about you is always positive, I come back even when I physically cannot, it takes courage to change peoples hearts. Then she said everything about you surprised me inspired me you have that courage you know. Then after that I told her about what happened almost 5 years ago, the look she had I will never forget, it’s like I was the only person on this fucking earth and I lost the only person that I felt comfortable and loved with all my life and heart. I would always check up on her when she was asleep she did little things that makes so much difference I remember that first cruise we took together, and we went to key west and another place I can’t remember, that was the 2 month we were together bc before she was very antisocial and I kinda was. I’m just getting mixed thoughts that I should. Kill myself on the cruise I’m going on, but then I worry about how my sister will feel knowing that I was the only one she has and that I killed myself. I’m just praying for something to happen this is the worst time of my life and I just feel or felt like devin which helped me before and acted like Trey just left and I get he’s working on himself, everyday I wake up I can’t stop thinking about everything. And I act like everything normal when I talk but some will see me listening to stuff, and I forget my mics unmuted, Alyssa would always call me when I was at work, bc we always were with eachother and I went there for a hour a day. She would always FaceTime, if I told that Vincent fucker I’ll be dead by now. Before she passed away she said that I always do the best for people and for me to continue it up, bc it got you somewhere. I have a concert I kinda half to do on the cruise, I love doing it but last time people saw me get emotional and a guy says why the fuck you crying asshole. Never had anyone that appreciated my work more than Alyssa, Trey and sometimes my sister. My mother would sometimes abuse me and call me names my father is worse. I just hate my family. I have another sister but idk what happened with her, she hasn’t contacted me or my sister since 2017, idk if my father did something to her idk. I want to find someone on a cruise ship and see if that works if it doesn’t, I’ll help Arry out. Wish I could go back to 2021 and 2020 to good times, even 2018. I’m going to go to sleep hopefully, just wish I could cry on her because she would help me with panic attacks and I would too. One time I couldn’t stop thinking about some dream and she was there, I’m going to try to stop thinking about it. Sorry for me ranting or something, guess that’s how I feel comfortable kinda. It just makes me happy to know that I helped others, I just want people to know that I’m honest, I always say I’ll see what I can do bc I’m used to it, guess when something does happen, guess I’ll be saying it’s good to know that people like the work we did.  Arry was literally saying that oh I’m all so serious and says that’s attractive. I feel like she needs to understand what I’m going through, I have 2 people like Arry that will always contact me kinda nonstop everyday I just want to have the confidence again be like in 2018 and focused, where I’m doing my work but I have the confidence knowing I have someone to look forward to, maybe it’ll happen god I hope so..” 

I only ask for some advice since my friend Trey that always helped me died 2 years ago and my current friend Devin is busy with focusing on himself, so I don’t really have anyone besides my sister and this one girl called Arry that wants to be with me but I said to her idk rn, I half to look at everything.",1,True

You did everything in your power to prevent it, and deserved absolutely none of it. It wasn't your fault. Your (I hope hope hope ""ex-"") BF is a monster. It's a common pattern of abusers ""apologizing"" during and/or after the assault, which is a manipulator's way of trying to shift blame from themselves onto their victim. It is not your responsibility to forgive them or absolve them for hurting you and raping you.

If you can, please tell your dad, and tell him you want to report your rapist to the police (if you can). It won't be easy, but the sooner you begin the reporting and disclosure to your support system, the sooner you can begin healing. Often times, rape victims stay silent for awhile, and when they finally come out and tell their friends or family, and police, sometimes the response is something like ""it couldn't have been that bad if it took you this long to say anything"". It's a horrible and unsympathetic response, but sometimes people are that way.

u56csg,,0,Low_Banana_5273,"Sadly there's no consensus on these words, not legally and not colloquially. Many prior sexual abuse victims consider a situation where someone hears no over and over or sees that their partner is visibly frightened but then goes through with it because suddenly their partner acts like they want it (because they're scared), that's still sexually abusive. I believe that, but others say not.

If you touch someone in a sexual way that they don't consent to, I believe that's assault and abuse, but not everything that's abusive or assault is rape. How clearly consent is communicated is a matter of subjective opinion, which is why many recommend considering anything non-consensual that isn't explicitly planned and agreed-upon ahead of time, but obviously that still runs up against the issue that sometimes people explicitly plan and agree-upon things ahead of time with others only because they feel threatened. According to the law as far as I know, it doesn't matter if you didn't have the intention to commit the crime or not. You can still be guilty for it even if you didn't mean to be guilty of it, and coercion is a crime, but how much you seemed to have intended it may influence sentencing.

In other words, you're receiving wildly differing feedback because a lot is very grey and not unanimous. Personally, I would call it this way. The first situation was likely rape but I can only speculate since we don't know if sex actually occurred, the second was coercive if your partner was able to see your hesitation and assault regardless because he touched your genitals without you wanting him to do that or agreeing to it, and the third probably was coercion and assault because you said no over and over and he was touching you anyway, until it also became rape.",2,False

u3baoc,,0,vaniziv,"Hey you, thx for sharing! :) 
First off one thing is very clear: This person is mentally i’ll in some
way and he very probably has assaulted his nephew so he is a perpetrator. 
The way he treated you on a basic human level was disgusting, inappropriate and definitely falls under the category of “Coercion”! 
Plus you were a child in a way. You were in a way I guess too young to and naive (not in a condescending way) to fully grasp what has happened to you, so you couldnt act accordingly. Also look into the Fight/ Flight/ Freeze/ Fawn - survival responses. You probably fall under one of those categories! 
It was not rape, cause for that he’d have to have “penetrated” one of your “openings” with whatever object or body part (sorry it sounds so horrible). But it was definitely abusive! He used you for his pleasure and disregarded your dignity and wishes. So I’d call it sexual abuse= He mistreated you in a sexual way. And it also falls under assault if someone touches you against your will. Google the definitions again for yourself. It’ll help.

And as for the guilt part: Even if you had gone to the police he still would’ve harmed his nephew. You could not have prevented it. And remember you were young, had no Idea about sexuality and got introduced to it in a toxic way+ got brainwashed. So I truly ask you to forgive yourself for feeling guilty cause in this case it is 100% his fault. If you had been like 30 when it happened, it’d be a bit different but again, you were too young. 
Also it is worth considering if you want to report this crime regardless of the possibility of the outcome. Cause it’s not about whether you “win” but rather to stand up for yourself and fight for your justice. And most importantly, even if they drop the case, he’ll be registered in the system and if one day another report is being filed against him, they’ll see yours as well and he’s more likely to get imprisoned ! 

Even tho you say you’re fine, do you have ways of healing/ coping ?

Just because you kissed him back does not mean is was not SA, however, if you never told him no, it also does not mean that it was. If you never expressly consented to any of it, it is borderline. However, you did say you kissed him back. So, in my opinion, and it is just that, an opinion. this was more of a miscommunication than a SA.

I would have a long talk with him, and if you are not comfortable doing this in person, do it over the phone, that your feelings are not the same as his and that you feel like he took advantage of the situation, because he did. I would not mince words and be as direct as possible. You should also tell him that if it happens again, then you will consider is SA.

For your part, I would strongly suggest backing off a bit on the friendship for a while. There are too many emotions at play on his end, and he is likely confusing the late night talks and everything else as a reciprocal set of feelings emerging on your end. I would also avoid spending any time alone with the guy for a while. I would not cut off the friendship completely, but there needs to be some solid boundaries in place on you end.

szsr8c,,0,Camerasweets,"I want to clarify that you do not have to say no for it to be considered rape. You must give consent. Anything sexual that happens without consent is considered sexual assault. 

There are also situations that negate consent.  Consent can’t be considered valid if the person is drunk or on drugs, or has impaired judgement in anyway. 

If there is any penetration at all, it is consisted rape. Penetration includes anything entering the vag or butt, even the smallest amount OR any sexual organ entering the mouth.  

If you didn’t explicitly consent to what was happening, then it’s sexual assault. Moreover, if you were drunk and even gave consent, it doesn’t count legally or morally. You need to be fully competent to give consent which means your judgement can’t be impaired by alcohol or drugs.  For consent to be valid, there needs to be disclosures as well. You can’t consent to something if you don’t know what it is. So, just because you went into the room with the person, doesn’t mean you agreed to sexual acts.  Whether or not you said no is irrelevant.  

The fact that oral sex was involved means there was penetration. According to the US government website, what happened to you was rape. I’m very sorry. There’s no way around it. This meets the requirements for rape. See definitions below. 

———-

“The penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim.” 

“The Elements of Informed Consent. (1) disclosure; (2) comprehension; (3) voluntariness; (4) competence; and (5) consent (see U.S. National Commission, 1978, U.S. President's Commission, 1982; Meisel and Roth, 1981).”

“Consent cannot be given by individuals who are underage, intoxicated or incapacitated by drugs or alcohol, or asleep or unconscious. If someone agrees to an activity under pressure of intimidation or threat, that isn’t considered consent because it was not given freely. Unequal power dynamics, such as engaging in sexual activity with an employee or student, also mean that consent cannot be freely given.”",2,False

sv8mun,,0,Due-Situation4183,"It's sexual touch you didn't consent to, so it's definitely sexual assault. That being said, he may not have meant for it to be like that. Problem is, some people are pretty much clueless when it comes to sex and consent. They end up thinking a relationship is synonymous with consent or as is the case with you and this post, the acts in question are just barely sexual enough that they have to question what it would really count as. Some people are even dumb enough they think that if they're only touching themselves and other people just happen to be around that it doesn't count. So, the way I see it, you've got some choices to make. You could stay with him if you think you'd be okay with it or you could leave. Either would be fully understandable and valid. But, if you do choose to stay he has to have a conversation about where the boundaries in this relationship are. Boundaries are different in every relationship, so a little confusion is understandable, but it's absolutely not an excuse to hurt, humiliate, or scare you. If you choose to give him another shot to be a better boyfriend he has to play within the boundaries of your relationship without question.

Next minute he was out of his pants trying to forcefully enter me and I got up and ran away and he chased me and held me down.  It was painful, he had full control of everything that occurred and pushed away my hands and feet when it moved outside of where he wanted.  I remember I came a couple of times, probably from the friction because I was confused about it, but at the same time thinking, ""why doesn't he know this is disrespectful to just jerk someones body around?"" and wondered why I felt so disconnected from him in an intimate moment.  I disassociated a bit, but at the same time was aroused.  Because maybe abuse is attractive to me?  I watched him after feeling loved up, and I asked him to leave so I could sleep.  For some reason I tried to continue the relationship after, like nothing had happened.  I guess I hoped he was inexperienced at sex and we could have more that was better?  Maybe there was another reason, I felt completely disconnected? He had seemed like such a nice guy.

The truth is he never had any respect for me as a person, either in sex or in any of his behavior.  Sex should be like walking hand in hand with each other and helping each other in the journey, not one person dragging or shoving the other.  If someone is abusive, no matter how nice they may seem at times, they're still going to drag you to get their own way at your detriment. It's an entitlement.  It pains me that for many women around the world, this is just normal.  It pains me that I see my ex out with other girls right now, knowing he's this monster.

qlphm1,,0,Plenty_Ad_2756,"Yes, it was 100% sexual assault. 

First off, you were too drunk to consent. 

Second, he manipulated you to get you to agree to having sex again after you told him you wanted him to stop because it hurt. Getting someone to say yes or to stop saying no (to stay silent and just take it) by any coersion, manipulation, guilt tripping, threats, ""light"" force and such, is NOT valid consent.

Third, he held your hands back and pushed your face into the pillow hard so that you'd feel discouraged to be able to stop him either physically (pushing him away with your hands) or verbally (saying anything is pretty hard if your face is shoved hard into a pillow - people could even suffocate like that, especially if you were to throw up a bit from the alcohol and start choking). He consciously chose to hold your arms back and push your head down hard, it was not just by chance. Consent can be revoked at any time which makes anything after if sexual assault/rape and you have to be able to and feel safe to revoke consent.

Fourth, you did NOT consent to him cumming on you and he knew that and chose to do it either way. If ANY act is done that is not consented to it makes it sexual assault. 

Is it advisable to know your limits and not drink past it? Yes. Is it advisable to always have one or more trusted, preferably female friend(s) with you when drinking to be safe? Yes. Is it advisable to always be extra vigilant with watching your drink and not accepting random drinks from others? Yes. Is it advisable to NOT go drinking and hook up with a random person toy don't know? Yes (a lot worse things have happened to girls/women). However, is any of this what should be the focus when someone is assaulted? NO. 

As a society we are too used to victim blaming when it comes to sexual assault. With no other crime do we focus more on the victim's actions than we do on the perpetrator's. It's also advisable not to leave your car unlocked with expensive things inside, not to walk out of a bank waving a bunch of cash, not to leave your house and leave the door open, etc. Yet the focus still tends to be on the criminal if, for example, you get held at gun point and robbed after walking around a sketchy neighborhood at night with a Rolex and expensive suit on - no one would say they were asking for it.

It should never be about what time of day it was, what the victim was wearing, what they have previously done (how many partners they've had, had they consented to sex with the person before, etc).

You shouldn't blame yourself either for what happened or think any less of yourself for it. It was not normal or expected. It was assault. If you need help, don't hesitate to reach out to a therapist experienced in dealing with sexual assault trauma - they really can help to process and heal.

Please, I know it's a hard process, but if you feel you can go through with it, report it to the police. It can be a big step in healing once it all seeps in what actually happened. It doesn't always lead to real justice but it can or at least partially. It can also open a file on them if there isn't one already making future aligations against them more seriously taken. It could also at least cost the bouncer his job so that he doesn't use it as preying grounds. 

I guarantee you they have done this before and will keep doing it until stopped. They count on their victims not being able to put up a fight, having trouble remembering, feeling shame or responsibile/at fault/guilt (which they really shouldn't as it's not even 0.01% something that is your or any of their victims' fault or anything to be ashamed about).

Seeing a therapist/counselor who's experienced in dealing with sexual assault trauma can be a big help in the process of healing. Don't be hard on yourself or negative to yourself - always affirm the positive even if you don't feel or think it because what you continually affirm will alter how you feel and perceive yourself.

It takes time and a lot of energy to fight through some of these. And to learn to stop fighting yourself. Each person is their own and some are never strong enough to report spending all their energy just to heal and not harm themselves.

It is your story to tell or not.

You have done so well telling now. It hasn't even been a year. People often take decades to find courage to overcome the fear.

As a survivor I'm proud of you.

And so is everyone else I assure you. Even though your dad's fear, frustration and anger comes out against you for being 'slow' he's proud.

He's even still in the Army.. but so was I, and so I know no one would believe me. To say nothing of the CSA, I really laugh when I think about reporting that lol.. I'm processing. We'll see where I end up. 

In the meantime, I'm thinking: first, I did try to tell, but felt physically unable to. (I kept saying 'we had sex but I said no' instead of 'rape', just...couldnt.) Did you experience something similar? If something is physically impossible can it really be morally required? Second, now that I'm telling my friends and family, I'm noticing that the worst reactions (ones that have hurt me the most) have come from the people that I thought loved me the most. But I'm resisting the conclusion that they love me less than I thought by remembering: Rape affects the brain more than the body. Our loved ones brains are affected too.. because part of love is to wanting people to be safe from the worst.. it's complicated, but common to get an overreaction from a parent. Or at least it happened to me too. 

My mom said: ""it's not my fault, you begged me to go to his house!"" I told my dad I wanted to die and begged for his help but he said nothing until I was mad then, mad himself: ""That's enough."" That was the hardest day not to kill myself in. Glad it's behind me.

But when I look at those memory.. it looks like it's killing them to hear this. Them in my brain rn it really looks like they couldn't bear to hear another word. I know Jack Nicholson was right.. Yall can't handle the truth. In most ways on most days, they treat me with love. Just to say it.

Anyway, all that to say rape is powerful stuff. You are doing the hardest thing in your life when it simultaneously alienates you from your support group, even if only in the hardest moments. That it took you less than a lifetime is exceptional. Lean on the people being kind to you now. Everyone who wants to will come around.

im writing about an additional incident that happened recently with the same person more for my own records and to see if maybe anyone sees this and can relate but ill probably end up deleting this thread.

I was having a bad time when I originally made this post and that may have been because I knew I had to be at his house the next day to see his dad about car stuff (his family donated an old car of their to me) and it made me idk not panic with ear so much but feel like I was melting down I guess. and I saw him as I was getting ready to leave it was fine I was like ugh wtf but okay hi yknow, but I ended up going to his house after errands were done to talk to him cause I was still in denial about the whole thing and I wanted to talk to him about it like ask him if he really meant to hurt me. he said he was sorry but didn't take accountability or responsibility. he saw I was anxious and we cuddled cause I needed a hug and I wanted so badly to feel safe with him again like when we first started seeing each other years ago. bad move.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't want to kiss him and after he tried to the first time I told him no kisses and he was like okay. then forehead kisses, im thinking ehhh but okay feels safe still cause its platonic. but eventually he kept trying to get me to kiss him and im not kissing back like im still confused about everything now your disregarding the one tiny thing I asked you not to do. I was already anxious and its getting hard to think straight and say what I need and and and eventually he tries getting me angry enough to hit him. like full on straddled me and held my wrists down trying to kiss me. im like yo wtf I said id bite him and I did but not enough to draw blood. and im getting more triggered as this goes on and like im starting to play along cause im like is this just being playful?

&amp;#x200B;

I tried really getting out and its like idk I started getting tired. and I still cant tell why he started doing it. like idk if he's trying to get me to go further or play fight or something. he starts saying do you want me to stop and im like yes and he's like what if I don't want to stop? and I said well that'd be different. as in id actually try to fight him and he's like go ahead and I try to get out but im too tired and weak at this point and getting triggered cause even if I really wanted to escape I couldn't. I started feeling like I was shutting down and he ended up getting up cause I was becoming more noticeably upset.

&amp;#x200B;

he starts to talk to me about it and im like what was your intention with that. I don't remember his answer cause memory doesn't work the same for me when im upset like that. and he point out that I was smiling during it so some part of me must've liked it. and when he asked me if I like it I looked to the left and answered no and he   tried point that out too as more evidence that I somehow deep down wanted that or enjoyed that. the smiling was nervous and the same kinda smile I give my dad when he's being abusive to my mom. it was an incredulous smile rather than filled with joy. the looking to the left was me trying to think like I have tics like that like I look up or whatever or roll my eyes when im thinking of what to say, not tremendously noticeable unless youre with me a lot of the time. but it was like he was trying to convince me somehow I liked what he was doing. literally trying to confuse and gaslight me.

&amp;#x200B;

I wrote an angry text to him the next day and haven't heard or reached out to him since. I told his dad about it and he was extremely understanding and I told him about the incident I originally wrote about. im glad to have gotten everything out to him and here too. its helpful knowing im not alone and. to have some validation and support I cant expect of everyone in my life.",2,True

mxuymr,,0,[deleted],"Thank you for sharing, OP. It must have felt very confusing for somebody you cared about to violate you in this way. This was rape. He didn't have your consent.

He said you wanted to touch it, and you got up to leave. That's a clear no. You clearly communicated your disinterest. He just wasn't listening. It wasn't his place to make those decisions for you.

With some men you can never be assertive enough. 

Lots of girls go into a weird freeze/trance when there’s a bigger stronger person ignoring and controlling us. It’s a neurological reaction and it stops you communicating clearly because your body has already sensed it is in danger and activated survival instincts.

mwmkas,,0,[deleted],"Honey it’s not your fault. You told him you didn’t want sex and he penetrated you before you even knew what was happening. Lots of girls completely freeze and can’t say anything at all - that’s what I did. You communicated effectively and said no, stop, and it’s not your fault you didn’t think of the safe word. A safe word is for kinky stuff when role play has been established - not for just regular sex. Had you discussed participating in a rape fantasy at all? Had you discussed reluctance kinks? 

You’d already told him you didn’t want to have sex anyway. He ignored that and did it anyway. 

Having a safe word isn’t how you say no it’s a last resort red light for a situation that has been pushed too far... it doesn’t mean he can ignore anything else you say. ‘No’ and ‘stop’ remain valid tools for communication that he should have listened to. 

My opinion is I think he knew how you’d react and set you up with unusual and unnecessary rules about how you can say ‘no’ and then shocked you into forgetting those rules. I think he manipulated you. I don’t want to tell you what to call this experience but the fact that you felt the need to go to a forum called r/rape says it all as far as I’m concerned.",3,False
mwmkas,[deleted]@0,1,[deleted],"To answer your question- no we hadn't discussed anything like rape fantasies when the word was made in place. The most I was okay with, sorry if this was weird, was choking. I am not necessarily into that, but he was and I didn't have an issue with that kink so I gave him the okay for that- even then if I said the word sometimes he wouldn't let go immediately which is why I am not too sure he would have stopped even if I had said the word for that,, time. I wasn't exactly used to the word though as I hadn't really had to use it before and like you said it definitely shocked me when it happened.

Some people have called it rape, some say I was a dummy for agreeing to the safeword but even those people say he should have stopped especially cause it was my first time and he should have been more careful and aware of that. I don't know why it confuses me so much.

I won't lie it also fucks with me that I did have consensual sex with him in the future after that- I pushed away the feelings and thoughts of the first time to a point were I had managed to just forget about it and bottle it up.

Thanks for responding it has given me a lot of clarity, I still am confused with the situation but your comment has made me feel more comfortable with my negative feelings towards it and I really appreciate you taking the time to write that out for me❤",1,False
mwmkas,[deleted]@1,2,[deleted],"Wow big red flag with him not releasing a choke immediately with a safe word. I’d call this situation rape. I’m sorry it happened to you. His use and application of the safe word doesn’t make sense to me - a safe word is to stop kink related activities. You hadn’t discussed any rape kink so why would you need a safe word to get him to stop? It just doesn’t make sense I think he is looking for an excuse.

And giirrl it’s fine I repressed all my negative feelings about my rape (because it was also confusing) and actually fell in love with my rapist. So I know all about that and I know how weird it feels. But it doesn’t change anything. 

I spent about three months telling myself that it was all my fault for not being clearer. Literally repeating it to myself like a mantra. So I also have really bad issues with accepting and labelling. I know how it is. Just know that your experience is valid and was in no way your fault.

Imagine being 27 now and seeing a 14/15 year old kid in a toilet and telling them to  go into a cubicle for sex.

If it helps I also went on autopilot and froze really quiclky after getting scared by a guy ignoring me while having sex. I just froze and then couldn't see any option for how to get him to stop, since he was ignoring or responding to my requests in an extremely minimal way and not talking to me at all.

This is a survival tactic. Rape is violent and scary. Unbeknownst to us, our brains take over during sexual assault and we resort to our habits/instincts.

For me, I wrote down a list of abnormal and/or instinctual things going on with my mind and body during the rape. Like my vision was blurry, I blacked out multiple times, I froze, I had simplistic/irrational thoughts, I relaxed my entire body and dissociated, etc. This activity has helped validate the truth that I was raped but that I also survived due to these instincts.

I remember freezing and semi deciding to stop trying to communicate with my “friend”/rapist after a certain point because the more I tried to get him to stop, the more like rape it felt and it was too much psychologically. I’m sorry it happened to you. 

If you were lying there while it was happening thinking about rape... girl I’m sorry :( it sounds like rape to me. 1) you were too drunk to consent (doesn’t matter about the guy being drunk it doesn’t change what you experienced) 2) guys know what is going on when they see their date get drunk/maybe he even helped you get drunk. 3) you cried or nearly cried at some point and he didn’t notice?? Being drunk is no excuse for that. I’ve been with some very drunk men and they noticed signs that I’m uncomfortable far smaller than that. 4) you don’t remember the night well because you were drunk and because it is traumatic. There is a good chance you did more than you remember to try and stop him but he ignored it and the memory of being ignored is too traumatic so it’s being blocked by your brain. Lots of things that I did to try and get away from my guy felt like they might be snippets from a dream and I wasn’t sure for months if it really happened.

Just because you tried to engage with it during the act doesn't make it more consensual, it just means your coping mechanism was to go along with it. 

Bottom line is that you were coerced into doing something you didn't want to do. Having an orgasm or going along with it don't make it any less coercive.

mqh167,,0,robertsmithscat,"fuck. 

i’m literally in the same shoes as you it’s uncanny. 

i’m currently in free services for sexual trauma therapy (UK) with a really nice lady and it helps a lot. 

however i had to be on a waiting list for 9 months before and the incident (like you) happened couple of years before that. so help has only been recent but i’ve found that several things have already been helping me a lot to process it.

no, you are not over reacting and what you’re experiencing is really common unfortunately. 

i would 100% recommend talking to your current bf about this. if he’s the right guy he’ll support you entirely like mine does. having a healthy sexual relationship with a guy like your bf helps process that what happened with your ex was wrong in comparison. it’s good that you realise that it made you feel gross and that you suspect it’s wrong of him - it’s a step forward.

traumas like this take a long time to process so it may feel like you’ve gotten no where since but you have and you will.

as therapy isn’t an option right now, i can recommend [this book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sexual-Healing-Journey-Guide-Survivors/dp/0062130730) to read when you feel you can and looking up articles (added some below). i did this to help me understand what i went through was wrong and why and it’s helped me become angry instead of guilty. hopefully this will become acceptance and i’ll be able to move on. i have a pinterest board full of articles if i need reminding that my feelings and experience is valid.

also, like you i continued to stay with my ex for several months after the first incident and this meant i normalised our ‘consensual’ sexual relationship even if it was fucked up. even today i still blame myself and feel bad for staying but abuse is complicated and what you have gone through is a type of abuse. eventually getting therapy is very important because your experience is your unique experience and my therapist said that we come to therapy as a whole person with context no matter why we’re getting help and context MATTERS SO MUCH. you can only really explore that context with a professional who knows what theyre doing - this can answer big questions that will help you move forward.

i can understand how seeing your ex now makes you feel that way. again i’m getting that too (too uncanny). last time i saw him he bragged how he saved his friend from being raped and he makes himself out to be a feminist and etc.... whilst he was hanging out with two underage girls...... so i can tell you your ex is doing the whole supporting #metoo as a cover. people who have something to hide will go these lengths and it’s sickening when you know who they really are and everyone else doesn’t. it’s so hard i know, it will get easier.

whether you expose him or not later, what matters is that you process this and get support.

sorry this is so rambley, i got excited i could relate (even if not for good reason) and my heart goes out to you x

mqh167,robertsmithscat@0,1,throwawayunsure7638,"Thank you so much for reading and responding. I've seriously just been bawling since I typed it all out. I hate that you can relate, but thank you. I've never told a soul about this and to hear that my feelings and experience are valid is just... such a weight lifted. 

I've just been beating myself up for so long thinking I'm being over dramatic. I feel so dumb for staying with him. Even aside from the assault he was a shitty, manipulative person, but I was too weak to leave. I did everything I could for years to just get his approval. If a friend told me they were in that situation, I would tell them it was abuse and not their fault. So why can't I say the same to myself? I hope I can get there.

I've just read so many horror stories about people telling their trusted partners about this stuff, and they just do a 180 on them. I don't think he'll do that and I know he's not right for me if he does, but jesus it's scary. I know I need to do it though. He was super supportive when I confided with him about my handsy elementary school teacher a while back. But this feels so different than that.

I hope there is a program like that here in the US. Thankfully I have an interview for a job with health insurance coming up and I might finally be able to get into therapy... god knows I need it!

Ugh yes, it just makes my skin crawl. I am in a very liberal town that has regular events and rallies for rape victims, and as I was looking at his page I saw he's been to like all of them. And he's actually praised for it by our mutual friends? Maybe he actually feels bad and is trying to make up for it in some weird way, but it feels more like a wolf in sheep's clothing.

ltwanp,,0,colebukowski,"I’m so sorry this happened to you but this is indeed sexual assault. The start of this is almost exactly the start of what happened to me and I dealt a lot with guilt after and placing the blame on myself for ‘putting myself in the situation’ but please don’t do that (it’s in quotations because I didn’t put myself in ‘the’ situation just like you didn’t, we both trusted a friend not to assault us and unfortunately were wrong). 

What he did was wrong and if he was a decent person he would’ve asked you out/made a move when you were conscious (to his knowledge). But instead he waited until you were vulnerable and to his knowledge unconscious. 

My advice would be to talk this through with someone you trust who you know won’t tell anyone and cut off contact with him completely. You can’t trust him not to do the same thing or something similar and him just simply texting ‘what are you doing’ shows he feels no guilt about it which is even more worrying. 

Again I am so sorry OP I know exactly what this confusion and worry and pain feels like but please just know you did nothing wrong and you are not alone.

It wasn't normal, it was very much rape, it was not your fault, and we all believe you. x",5,False
kiu6m1,,0,Nebula_Smart,"Hi again friend!

Firstly, I really hope you're ok right now, you've been posting a lot recently and I know personally when I do that I can be heading for a bad time (a kind of preoccupation with the event as you will) - give us a heads up if things aren't ok? That would make an internet stranger happy!

You mention you're in therapy, do you have close friends or family you can also talk to about this? Or at least people around to keep you company?

In answer to your question - yes, I feel that way too, and it's only been 3.5 years, so I dread to think what you're going through 12 years later, that's super rough and you have all of my condolences and respect for living with this - it's in no way easy. 

Some immediate suggestions (based on what's helped me): 

1. Talking therapies are great to a point but then they can get us trapped in the same loops over and over again, have you tried EMDR or another approach?
2. Exercise, no matter how gentle will help you - have you read the body keeps the score? It's a heavy, but enlightening read on the impact of trauma on our minds and bodies and how to ""unstuck"" ourselves and try to move on
3. Did you ever say anything to the authorities? Would you consider it if not? Reporting my abuser and getting everything out in the open at least made me feel like things were progressing, and the more open you are about it the easier it becomes (strangely). For me, people here and offline \*telling\* me that I was raped and sexually assaulted and BELIEVING me, helped me massively when it came to accepting that yes, that had indeed happened, yes, it's illegal, yes it is frighteningly common, and no, the world is not just or fair. Or have you spoken to your friend about what she experienced too? There's strength and compassion in numbers I've found.

kb053g,,0,WhiteHandOfDoom,"Ideally, he could have asked if you want him to touch your pussy, but if he did touch you and you asked him to stop and he stopped, then it sounds like he did actually respect your boundary as soon as it was stated. This is good.

He is aware that you have no experience, so even though he initiated contact, to try and see if you would like to progress, (and you stated that you don't), next day he realized that initiating contact without asking might have made you uncomfortable and he confirmed that he is aware of that and sorry. That is also good.

The fact that he initiated this contact while you were drunk moves the situation into a sketchy territory, as you cannot give conscious consent when drunk, so if you would give consent, it wouldn't really count.

So if he would proceed cause you agreed, this would look more like taking an advantage of a drunk person. If he would proceed even though you did not agree, that would be abuse.

Since you didn't agree and he respected, I'd say everything is ok.

The fact that he did initiate is just a fact of life when two people are passionately kissing for 40 minutes under influence of alcohol. We'd expect some initiatives to happen in this situation.

As stated before, this could have been improved by verbally asking whether you want to be touched in certain places or by progressing from touching the parts of your body that you are ok with being touched in, to other areas and observing your body language.

Still, the act of initiating touch, in our eyes, is not abusive is this situation.

Do you think I can do something to make this situation better?",1,True
kb053g,[deleted]@1,2,WhiteHandOfDoom,"Your emotions and feelings are valid.

1. You weren't ready to escalate beyond kissing.
2. He tried to escalate.
3. It did make you feel uncomfortable.
4. You said no.
5. He respected that.

These are all facts. Fact number 3 is that you did indeed feel uncomfortable. Even uncomfortable enough as to come to this space to ask for support.

Your feelings are real. You are feeling in a certain way because of this situation.You are feeling bad about this and you communicated that to him. This is good and normal and totally ok.You didn't do anything wrong by telling him how you felt about your interaction.

Him feeling guilty for how he made you feel (even if he didn't mean to make you feel uncomfortable) is just a part of being in an interaction with another living, breathing, and feeling human being. He did, after all, make you feel bad about this. He will survive feeling a little guilty.

You do not need to feel bad nor trying to save him from feeling a bit bad about this. There are people who will play a victim and expect consolation when you tell them they have hurt you in some way, turning the issue around and making it about them. That is a manipulation tactic. We do not fall into that trap.

What you could do is to try and process this together. You do not need to meet for this in-person. We would even advise against a meeting until this is resolved to your satisfaction. Few walls of text or a phone conversation would suffice.

You can tell him, in no uncertain terms, **how you feel** about him touching you, and the entire situation. It is only fair to mention also **how you feel** about the fact that when you said no, he respected that boundary.

You can talk about that at length, because you are very competent in the matter of your own feelings. You do not need to define whether what he did was ""bad"". You only need to define how you felt about it. If you felt bad, that is enough grounds for discussion, letting him know how you feel, and expecting apology and assurance that you will be able to have your boundaries respected next time you meet (if that happens).

He might want to have a chance to explain that he respects you and didn't mean to overstep your boundaries. He might want to have a chance to promise that he will not do that again without asking verbally.

k0fh4l,,0,[deleted],"Trauma bonding is very insidious and poorly understood by anyone who has not experienced it or been educated on how it works. Since most people do not understand, and use healthier relationships they have been in as their frame of reference, we often hear them say things about situations like ours that are very wrong and very hurtful, but are the thoughts that come up when we ourselves are faced with a trauma bond situation. Things like ""she brought it on herself, why didn't she just leave, she's weak if she just went along with everything he said, why didn't she fight back?"" It's normal to blame ourselves at the time and after the assault happens because of what we've heard about people in situations like ours, and to an extent, blaming ourselves makes us feel like we had more control over the situation than we really did. It's a maladaptive attempt to try to have control over the situation in some way. Everyone around me blamed me for getting into the situation I ended up in even though I was only fifteen when it started and he was older and had a lot of power over me in several ways, so I blamed myself too. It wasn't until this year when I described what happened to me to someone and they went ""I'm so sorry, I had no idea, you can't just pretend that didn't happen, it's not healthy"" that I kind of reevaluated everything and realized the extent of what happened to me - I was groomed and repeatedly raped for the majority of my high school years after being sexually assaulted on our first date and I just kind of went along with whatever he wanted after that and let him coerce me into sex. He left me and I had a breakdown and had an inability to reintegrate with the real world after he controlled me as much as he did for as long as he did. Before that I had mentally framed it as me being a stupid, rebellious kid who wanted to get hurt and willingly made the same mistakes over and over, because that's how everyone else around me treated me and other people in situations like mine. To some extent, thinking of it like that helped me cope and carry my weight until I was in a place I could actually emotionally handle the true gravity of the situation, but at the same time, as it was maladaptive, it also did a lot of damage I now have to try and undo. I can definitely empathize with how you're feeling right now. It really is comparable to being in a cult. It's been a bit over 10 years and I'm still undoing a lot of the brainwashing, including a lot of negative self-talk.  
I apologize for the novel, I've been invalidated a lot by people who don't understand trauma bonding and I can be a little eager to empathize with people who have experienced similar situations because I know how few people truly understand it.",1,False
jxk1ax,,0,wasabiwarrior21,"100% sexual assault. As a female when a man keeps pushing you over and over asking for the same thing you start to feel as if you have no choice. Many men don’t understand that in bed saying no doesn’t mean forcefully convince the person. You have every right to feel how you feel because what he did to you is definitely sexual assault, hopefully knowing this will help you get over the feelings. The fact that you had to put yourself in a different place mentally during the sex and you trying ur best to not give in to him shows clearly you have no consent. 

In my opinion with regards to your current boyfriend, if you feel it would help you to tell him the details tell him, if not leave it how it is and let him be there for you. The fact that he got upset about it just shows he cares for you a lot and who wouldn’t get upset if their gf said something that personal and hurtful and shared it to them. Maybe if you do fully open up and let him be there for you it will hurt a lot in the moment but later help with the intimacy probably as you will have more trust in him knowing he knows such sensitive info and is standing next to you as ur rock. 

Regardless of everything, I’m sorry you feel the way you feel and I hope the situation gets you a little hard headed and caring less of others feelings so you can protect yourself more and finally move on. I know a situation like that could take years to fully process but you have every right to feel how you feel about it and it was definitely sexual assault. I hope you and your boyfriend get through this together and I know you still have feelings but to your ex any man who does such a thing should burn.",1,False
jxk1ax,,0,sparkelsugar,"You were raped and sexually assaulted multiple times. Sex with someone unconscious/black out drunk is rape, no exclusions. Coercing you into sex even after you saying no multiple times, even if you finally say yes, is rape. Forcing you to sit in front of him naked while he jerked off, against your will, is sexual assault. 

I hope you can learn that in absolutely NO WAY is any of what happened your fault. He took advantage of you in nearly every way possible. Regardless of your age, what he did was wrong and is especially troubling when you bring up the fact of your respective ages at the time.

It is completely normal to feel the way you do. Nearly every rape/sexual assault victim feels guilt and shame, as if it is their fault but it is never the victim's fault, no exceptions. It is also completely normal to still have feelings for your assailant. If he was your first love, or even your first relationship period, it is natural that there would be fond memories attached to that relationship and that person. 

You can enjoy the good memories you have of him, but realize that, at the end of the day, this man hurt you in unimaginable ways that have greatly impacted you, and that's not okay. He SHOULD feel bad. Just remember that the guilt he feels for hurting you will never compare or size up to the hurt that YOU feel. 

It is up to you to tell your current boyfriend or not about the specifics of your trauma. If you think it will help you to move on, or begin to move on, then do it. Even if it's difficult.

1og3yu0,,0,badbubbeleh,"Hello love,

I am so so deeply sorry that this happened to you and that you are going through this. Of course you are deeply hurt, confused, ashamed and even feel guilt. First, I want to say that that is all so normal given what you have gone through. More importantly, I want to be very clear that this is NOT your fault. 

You know yourself. Everything you have just shared with us makes it very clear that you did not consent to this. You are happy in your relationship with no interest of sleeping with anyone outside of it. You usually handle your liquor well. You were pretty sober— maybe tipsy, but definitely not blackout to the point where you barely remember the night, how you wound up in bed with  a stranger or found yourself in a field almost two hours from home the next morning and missed work. None of that is normal or okay. I know you are spiraling and questioning everything, but I want to ask you to please do your best to quiet your mind and trust your gut right now. Trust yourself. 

I also want to say that even IF you had “consented” in that state— that is not consent. If you are not sober enough to make a sound decision about having sex with someone, especially someone you do not know, that is not informed consent. That man knew better. He also knew you were in a relationship. He knew you were in no state to have sex— even if he hadn’t spiked your drink. But it is very clear that he spiked your drink and took advantage of you. That is assault.

It also makes sense that you felt scared and uncomfortable to report what happened to the police— especially two men. That is so common, especially when you feel confused and ashamed on top of it all. It’s okay. You did what you felt comfortable with and that is the best you can do, okay? Don’t punish yourself for doing your best in a very scary and painful situation, please. You don’t deserve that. 

I imagine if you don’t tell your boyfriend, it will eat at you and you will feel guilty for something you did not do. For that reason, I would tell him if or when you feel ready to relieve yourself of that weight. My hope is that he is supportive, because that is what you need right now and sharing what happened to you with someone you love and trust can be healing after an experience like this. If you do not think he will handle it well and it will only bring you more pain and stress, then don’t tell him. Do what is *best for you* right now. Only tell him if and when you feel ready. If you don’t tell him, is there someone else you can talk to? Or maybe you could share with someone else *first* and then eventually share with him? Is there an older adult you can share with, maybe another woman?

He may feel upset about what happened, but I would hope that those feelings are upset for what happened to you and not that someone had sex with you while blacked out. You did not do anything wrong. You are young, so I don’t know how he will react or if he is mature enough to understand these things, but I hope he is and does. Regardless of how he reacts, I want to reiterate again and again that *none of this is your fault.*

The fact that this man reached out to you afterwards is fucking disgusting. The audacity. My last note is that since you now know his identity, I might report him while everything is fresh, but only if you feel comfortable. I might also go to a hospital and speak with a woman specifically to ask for an evidence kit, so that you have proof. Again, only do this if you feel comfortable. Please don’t put yourself through anything that feels too overwhelming right now. I am only making a suggestion as an outsider looking out for your wellbeing in the case that you do want to press charges in the future.  

Thank you for having the courage to share this with us, especially when everything is so fresh and overwhelming. I am sending you so much love and care while you go through this. Please do your best to take care of yourself and know that you are not alone.",1,False

1og3yu0,,0,madworld3232,"First of all I'm so very sorry this happened to you, you don't deserve this and it's not your fault. It is impossible to consent to sex when you're black out drunk and very likely under the influence of date rape drugs. Since it's been less than 24 hours a drug test may be able to detect the presence of a drug that was used on you. That would give you another answer to a question you will have; was I drugged? Find out now while it's possible. Get all the evidence now, you can decide to pursue charges later. 


Let the police do their jobs, but only if you want to, you're under no obligation to do anything but care for yourself right now. SA is about power, something some people fail to acknowledge, they get so hung up on the sexual aspect. This is where so much blame is unfairly placed on women. If the bf's and husbands realize it's about power it would be so much easier to understand that a woman gets absolutely nothing out of a man overpowering a woman. There's no pleasure, it's a cruel game for the predator. That's why the dude is contacting you, he wants to intimidate you, he may even try to convince you that you asked for it. He's a danger to you in multiple ways. Tell your mother the man's name, tell her everything, let her help you. I'm so sorry this happened to you. I hope you'll be gentle with yourself, you've been through a terrible trauma. Getting a therapist to unpack all this with will help you immensely. Take care sweetheart, you are not alone.",1,False

If you really want to, I recommend talking through things in therapy.

This is clearly bothering you and you said you have a bunch of other stuff to work through so I would recommend a good trauma therapist (ideally one who can work with emdr, ifs and somatic experiencing) who can guide you through these questions.



I would focus on the symptoms you currently experience in your day to day life e.g., any discomfort around intimacy or in certain parts of your body, fear of certain places...then work back from there by focusing on that discomfort and trying to ubderstand it more. The main thing is to try and have the best version of your life now that you can, rather than solve all of the mysteries (as reassuring as that would be). I would recommend therapies that deal with the bodies stored/implicit memory e.g., somatic therapy. That has been known to better connect people with memories they don't have a clear visual of.

By being sharp with you and distancing himself when you didn't want to have sex, that is coercion. When he then had to be pushed of of you, is violently raping you. In sex, concent is when both people say ""yes"" without being coerced. Even if you did say "" yes, let's do this"" it was still rape because he used his control over you to get the answer he wanted.
He's dangerous and I am so happy that you are away from him. Please tell any adult that you trust about this.

Same dynamic minus the praise or any actual affection.

I kept testing her logic on the things she could remember, and it was actually even more messed up than the bad memories she had come back were

I connected the dots and kinda analyzed some of the events that took place during their 8-month ordeal. And...

He was actually using the sexual torture to mind condition her for sex trafficking. He was a pimp and he was her ex from 3 years before.. he came back, and he broke her. We have at least one instance of him selling her that she at the time didn't even realize was happening. She was in every sense of the word.. owned.

Trauma bonds. Dumbest evolutionary ""advantage""
She couldn't remember the torture and pain because it was too hard to have both perceptions of him being a lover and a sadistic asshole. So if she had seen him later on the street, there were no red flags, no danger signal.. just ""old friend I want to like me"" after 8 months of of sexual assault, torture, degradation, and pain. 
She couldn't keep any of it and be a functioning human even if it would help her learn to avoid it.

Give yourself grace. You have been through a lot and when intercourse is associated with trauma of course your body would have a negative reaction. If you associate pain with sex then your brain will automatically be prepared for that pain which can cause the muscles to tighten and tense up making it even more uncomfortable for you.

Feeling really sexual like that after being assaulted is normal - doesnt happen to everyone but it's a very widely acknowledged thing,

 ""This shift towards hyper-sexual activity can be caused by wanting to reclaim control of the situation or your body through sex. It can also be spurred by a lack of care or concern for your body post-assault which leads you to engaging in potentially riskier sexual activities.""https://www.helpguide.org/mental-health/ptsd-trauma/sex-and-intimacy-after-sexual-trauma

lets say you and your friend are in the process of drinking tea. and your friend doesnt want to drink tea anymore. do you grab the cup, and splash the tea onto their face? scream why? you love tea? 

lets say your friend is asleep. do you wake them up by forcing their mouth open, and pouring tea into their mouths?

1hje6y8,UnitedCanary1245@0,1,noseykeyser,"Sorry but with respect I honestly don’t see how you can even come to this conclusion that you think that the OP was sexually assaulted just because the OP didn’t consent to any of this and that the male was far more sober than the OP?

The reasons why I say this is because first of all the OP clearly says that she was extremely drunk.  If the OP was extremely drunk then she could never give her consent to the male anyway due to the OP being intoxicated, so your initial point and basis that the OP was sexually assaulted here by the male because she didn’t give him her consent is completely irrelevant because she couldn’t possibly give him her consent anyway, even if she wanted to or even if she verbally told him that she does consent.

The second issue I have here with what you have said in your comment that the OP was sexually assaulted by the male on the basis that he was far more sober than the OP is also not of sound basis.  Consent is not defined or determined by who is more sober than the other person.  Just because one person might be drunker than the other or one person might be more sober than the other that doesn’t mean that the person who is the least drunk or the most sober (both the same thing) is the  actually committing sexual assault or rape in that situation.  

In addition to that the OP stated that she was extremely drunk but she also clearly stated that the male was also drunk too ‘but she didn’t know how drunk he was’ the OP also said later on in her post ‘that they were both drunk’ so I really don’t understand how you even managed to come to the conclusion that the male was far more sober than the OP was, because absolutely nowhere in the OP’s original post did she say anything like the male was more sober than she was, she also said that she didn’t know how drunk the male was, so how did you even come to the conclusion that he was more sober than the OP? 

And finally the OP said in her post that she was extremely drunk and that he, the male, was also drunk but she doesn’t know how drunk he was, then the bottom line here is that neither of them were able to give their own consent to each other to engage with each other in any kind of intimacy or sexual activity or sexual acts.

To the OP, in answer to your original question as to whether you were sexually assaulted here or not by this male, the honest answer, which might not be the answer that you want to hear is that in my personal opinion No he didn’t sexually assault you here as per the description of events that you outlined in your post above.  That doesn’t mean to say OP that the way you feel and the emotions of that you have about all of this and what happened, your shock, disgust, nausea etc etc are not justified and not valid because they are, they totally are and they are also all completely natural and understandable feelings and emotions that you are having and experiencing when you take into account and consideration what you also said in your post about how you have never ever been into him and that you didn’t want to kiss him and that you wouldn’t have done any of this if you were sober.

However both the law and the principles of consent are very clear here and based upon the information that you have provided in your post describing everything that happened here then it would be determined that this male didn’t sexually assault you.  

(On a totally unrelated note, I do personally feel very uncomfortable with regards to this males ‘over eager’ so to speak,conduct and behaviour here in this whole situation, where he was clearly the ‘driving force’ and party in all of this)

I am not saying this to invalidate your feelings, but to highlight that whether this is a form of assault or not it does not change the effect it had on you. You are clearly really affected by this. Something I have learned eventually is that sexual intimacy is a complicated thing that can have slipups and unsavory moments, especially the less experienced we are and the higher the stakes are for us (as when you have trauma and missteps can trigger you).

What's the most important thing here is that your trust in this person and their ability to make you feel safe was shaken. I would feel betrayed if I was in your shoes probably. I think you need to sit with yourself and figure out whether there is a way for him to regain that trust, and if there isn't what that means for your relationship.

I read a book recently that tried to define sexual consent not as something black and white that has to do with maintaining control (which they argue isn't 100% possible in sexual intimacy) but as giving up control, which as someone who has become a control freak in most aspects of my life since my SA was greatly illuminating. And I guess here my question would be could you trust this person again with giving up control over yourself, even a little? Eventually? What would the situation need to be like for that to happen?

Anyways I am really sorry for your experience. Take care no matter what your future looks like.",1,False

1h93ecx,noseykeyser@1,2,BlanKatt,"I think if it helps her or you think of it like that then it is so. My experience is that there is such a thing as blurry boundaries and especially if you have traumatic experiences that is ten times more difficult. To me sexual assault means violence, and I don't mean that it has to look a certain way but that it has to fit certain prerequisites because ultimately it's a legal term.

Technically speaking penetration of any kind without consent would be rape. Is this rape? I don't think I, a stranger on the internet can say, and I think we have been too gaslit by media about what we need to do and say in order for our realities to have any weight, to be acknowledged. Her feelings on the situation (many of our feelings) matter regardless of whether we use that language or not. She's allowed to be pissed or upset regardless.

1h93ecx,,0,[deleted],"This is sexual assault. SA can happen even if you initially give consent and then want to back out. It can also happen even if you don’t say no or voice concern in the moment. A partner should always ask even as you’re going along what’s okay and what isn’t. Especially before doing something new. 

What makes this particularly damning is that you told him way way ahead of time that you don’t want this— so you did NOT give your consent. You might’ve given your consent to giving head, but you previously explained that you would not be okay with your head being shoved. 

Therefore, he violated your consent so this is SA. 

Break up with him sooner before later. He will continue to push your boundaries. He knew what you didn’t want and still did it anyways. He did not “forget” I can promise you that. People do not lose all control during sexual acts. It might lower inhibition, but you’re still a conscious human being capable of logical thought. Any excuse he might come up with is bullshit. A person like this could be or have the capacity to be abusive in other ways (because this in and of itself is abuse).",-2,False

Sorry but the only person here is getting confused is you.

First of all the OP’s boyfriend didn’t just push a boundary of her’s, he absolutely broke her boundary, no ifs or buts.  Her boundary in this regard was very clear, that being that she doesn’t give her consent to have her head pushed down during the sexual act of her giving oral sex.  

He broke her boundary in specific regards to that and therefore he didn’t have her consent to do that and as a result this would unequivocally be a case of sexual assault by him against her.  It’s completely acceptable for the OP to give her consent to giving her boyfriend oral sex and her not giving him her consent to force her head up and down.  

Secondly your point that only the OP knows her boyfriend and if he is rude and disrespectful man, is a complete load of nonsense, it doesn’t matter how long she has known him, it doesn’t matter how well she knows him, it doesn’t even matter if he isn’t rude or disrespectful, these are not prerequisites that determine whether a person is capable of sexually assaulting someone or not. I don’t even know her boyfriend but based upon the information that the OP has provided in her post, I can categorically say, with absolute certainty that he sexually assaulted her.  

Thirdly you also said that in your comment that if the OP’s boyfriend treats her with respect and loves her, then this could have been an honest mistake by him? This is another load of nonsense from you because if he does treat her with respect and loves her, then he would have remembered her boundaries and he would have respected them in the first place.  

Just to finally say that the reason why the OP needed to have that conversation with him was to let him know that he broke one of her boundaries that she had told him about on several different occasions and how it and he made her feel and also the seriousness of it (albeit she didn’t tell him that it was sexual assault because she didn’t know herself whether it was classed as being sexual assault) but also to find out what his reasons were for breaking that boundary in the first place.  His response and answer to why he did was a complete load of nonsense, there is absolutely nothing at all that would be a justifiable answer, not one!!

1fw6r6o,,0,throwawaytonsilsayy,"Well, firstly let’s digest this part 

&gt;If I had liked him back, I probably would’ve loved what happened 

And let’s reword it

&gt;If I had consented, I would’ve enjoyed it 

Of course you would’ve enjoyed it, because you would’ve been consenting! But what happened wasn’t consensual. He assaulted you. 

This can apply to literally any scenario. 

“Well if he didn’t assault me and allowed me to consent and I liked him and things felt safe and he respected my boundaries and was a good person and had good communication and..and..(etc)..then I would’ve liked it!”

If we need to change a person and situation entirely to become “okay” with it, it wasn’t a good situation. He wasn’t a good person.

You pushed him off, didn’t consent, etc and he still tried to pressure you and I believe the only reason he didn’t go further is because of his roommates. He was scared you’d scream or make a fuss and expose his behavior. 

You don’t NEED to feel a huge reaction. Sometimes being numb is part of trauma but also it could just..not be that damaging for you emotionally. Not everyone reacts to SA the same. BUT, to clarify, just because you weren’t drugged or brutally raped or something doesn’t mean this wasn’t SA. It very much was. 

Don’t force yourself to feel things if you don’t. But definitely do not continue talking to him. He WILL actually rape you if you do. Again, the only thing stopping him was the fear of being caught.


**edit** he literally said he would’ve gone further but he was worried about his roommates. Meaning he saw you pushing him off, saying no, etc and STILL would’ve went further and WANTED TO. This is a man who will rape you if given the opportunity. Cut him off.",5,False

I get the idea of ""if I was okay with it, it'd be okay"", it's exactly why I said I wished I liked him back, so I'd been happy for once following my heartbreak ya know

  
He said he was sorry multiple times which I don't buy at all ofc. Not only did he ask me multiple times if ""I was upset at him"" indicating he's only saying he's sorry so I forgive him and move on, but also you cannot apologize for doing something without even understanding why it's wrong and he definitely doesn't understand why what he did was wrong past me being upset at him afterwards. There was also ofc the hilarious moment during the ordeal itself where he said he's sorry I've had to go through such a tough life and then promptly made it worse 💀

1flw2pi,,0,Excellent_Nothing_86,"First off, you’re not responsible for being assaulted. Freezing is a totally normal and common response to sexual assault.

Second, you’re reaching out for help, so even if you are sick and twisted (everyone is in some way, let’s face it), you want to get better. That’s a win in my book. Showing up for yourself is the most important thing you can do for yourself, and you’re doing it.

It’s ok to have conflicting emotions. Relationships of any kind are never usually very simple, so it’s ok to like and even miss someone who hurt you. Let me repeat that… **it’s ok to like and even miss someone who hurt you.**

Do you mind if I ask… what kind of trauma work have you done in the past? You mentioned your progress. Was that with some kind of therapy? Are you still in therapy? What meds do you take? And does your boyfriend know the extent of what happened with you and his friend? Did you tell him your truth?

Reading your story brought back a memory of mine that I haven’t thought about in *forever*. I was semi-together with the (older) boy who ended up being my first boyfriend. He was sorta dragging his feet on committing to me, but he knew I wanted to be with him.

I was hanging out with some friends one night and my friend’s older brother had some friends over, too. One of them was the best friend of the boy I liked (who wasn’t there). He ended up forcing me to kiss him (I was 13 and he was 15 or 16). I didn’t want to do it, but it felt nice to be wanted. He knew I didn’t want to kiss him but he kind of overpowered me and pressured me into it. 

I told the guy I liked (who did become my boyfriend), and he was obviously upset. He was upset with his friend, and hurt that it happened. But, we did move past it (even worse drama kind of took over, tbh. my friend’s older brother lied to him and told him I gave him head, which I didn’t).

Anyways - I still saw that guy around and we were still sorta friends. But, I could never trust him or really be friends with him. I didn’t really care that much about him to begin with, and he was bad news. So, there was no love lost. But, it definitely sucked that it affected the dynamic of things. Because we couldn’t undo it, and it was a shitty thing. 

And… it wasn’t my fault. Same as what happened to you wasn’t your fault. You can take accountability for what happened, but you don’t have to take responsibility for being assaulted.",2,False

The most she can say is she regrets it and hoped that she made a different decision but she can’t put the blame on him now 9 years later unless she also assumes she hasn’t changed at all in 9 years 💀",1,False

1eoeq1x,,0,ContextOwn6252,I’m so sorry! It’s sexual assault. You said no maybe next week. You agreed to kissing. You didn’t agree to him forcing himself inside of you. It’s not your fault because you froze either. He knew you didn’t want to have sex. He kept manipulating the situation. You trusted him and he knew he could keep pushing your boundaries. You’re not being over dramatic. Your body should be respected.,11,False

1eoeq1x,,0,LavenderTree9295,"This most definitely was not even remotely okay, I completely agree with the comments. This was NOT you’re fault, you where clear in stating you’re boundaries. In a lot of cases, the person doing the assault manipulates the victim into thinking that their at fault or makes it less then what it is. I went through this myself and beat myself up over freezing as well, but it’s a coping mechanism! It’s you’re brain that sort of shuts down for emotional protection, this happens when going through something traumatic, so it’s definitely not “over dramatic”. What you’re friend did is also something I have experienced myself and I’m so sorry you had to go through that on top of what you’ve already experienced. The biggest thing with SA, is the shame the victim is left with which they don’t deserve, that you don’t deserve. The person who assaulted you deserves that shame.

1ejayzp,,0,[deleted],"Hi, understand your definition confusion and naming convention discrepancy that can be seen online.as i understand this is only for your clarity as mentioned you will not take any action . I would use a common sense approach: hints and suggestions about sex appeared before event and more agressivly in words after. There was no confusion, no coincidence before what drives him. You communicated without a doubt that nothing like that is allowed to happen again. Intentions and behaviours presented can be considered as assualt with sexual intention so Yes, i would say SA. As usual with Such cases confusion with interpretation occurs. To me or to you it shouldnt matter that much, especially since you dont plan to take any further action. You did not consent to any form of touch in that way. Whether someone call it sexual battery/assualt or even groping this is still considered an unacceptable behaviour that could be taken further in action via court. Hope that you are sure about allowing this person back to your life. Seems that you are sure, i will not ""push"" any of my suggestions in regards that. Anyway - great response reaction.

I have something for you for future reference 👇. 

The acronym ""FRIES"" is used to remember the key components of consensual sex, as promoted by organizations such as Planned Parenthood. Here’s what each letter stands for:


1. **Freely Given**:
    - Consent must be given without any form of pressure, force, manipulation, or under the influence of substances. 
    - If someone feels coerced, threatened, or obligated in any way, their consent is not freely given.
    - For example, saying ""yes"" out of fear of the other person’s reaction is not freely given consent. 
    - Consent should come from a place of mutual willingness and comfort.


2. **Reversible**:
    - Consent is not a one-time, binding agreement; it can be withdrawn at any moment, regardless of previous activity.
    - If someone initially agrees to engage in a sexual activity but then changes their mind, their decision must be respected immediately.
    - Continuing any sexual activity after consent is withdrawn constitutes sexual assault.
    - Reversibility emphasizes that consent is ongoing and must be maintained throughout the interaction.


3. **Informed**:
    - All parties should have all necessary information to make an informed decision about participating in the sexual activity.
    - This includes being honest about health status, use of contraception, and intentions.
    - For example, lying about using a condom or hiding an STI means the other person’s consent is not fully informed.
    - Informed consent ensures transparency and honesty, allowing individuals to make decisions based on all relevant facts.


4. **Enthusiastic**:
    - Consent should be enthusiastic and active, not reluctant or passive.
    - If someone isn’t excited or is unsure, it’s a sign they may not be giving genuine consent.
    - An enthusiastic ""yes"" is clear and unambiguous, indicating that the person is eager and willing to participate.
    - Enthusiasm helps to ensure that both parties are fully and happily engaged in the activity.


5. **Specific**:
    - Consent must be specific to each activity and cannot be assumed for other activities.
    - Agreeing to one form of sexual activity does not imply consent to others.
    - For instance, consenting to kissing does not mean consent is given for further sexual acts.
    - Specificity helps prevent misunderstandings and ensures that boundaries are respected.

Each of these points ensures that consent is clear, mutual, and respected, creating a safe and respectful environment for all involved.

Everyone is different, but if I was worried I had possibly violated someone, I would ask how they felt about the ordeal. I will repeat that it doesn't sound like you assaulted her, but that doesn't mean that it couldn't have affected her in a way, as all experiences are subjective.

I'm so sorry that this happened to you, I'm pleased that you have felt able to come here and get advice. So, I think that for you to be able to put a label on what happened you need to understand how consent works. So here's the basics of consent. 

There is something called the FRIES acronym. It states that unless all of these conditions are met, sex or sexual activity is not sex, it is rape or assult. Yes, doesn't always mean yes, if it does not meet this criteria. Someone used it to explain to me why what happened to me was rape. Since I've been in this sub I use this alot to explain to people why what happened to them wasn't okay.

So for consent to be valid it must meet the following conditions. 

FRIES stands for -

F - Freely given. If you have to pester someone for consent, ask them over and over again, tell them that if they loved you they would sleep with you, then consent is not freely given, you manipulated them into giving it. No means no. No doesn't mean yes, or try harder, it is a complete sentence on its own and the only correct response is to accept it and move on. If you say no after being influenced by him to say yes, that is corsion. 

R - Reversable. If you say yes, but then by the time you've made it to the bedroom you change your mind, then you can withdraw that consent. If you are having sex, and you change your mind, the minute you say no, or stop, consent has been withdrawn. If he forces you after that or doesn't stop immediately, then that is rape.

I - Informed. Consent must be informed consent. That means that you should know all of the potential risks and benefits of that activity. If you do not know that by having sex with someone you could catch an STD that they know they have, then that was not informed consent.

E - Enthusiastic. There should be absolutely no questioning wether you want to take part in sexual activity. If you do not say, 'Oh! Yes please, that would be lovely!' but instead you are saying 'Urgh. Go on then.' that is not enthusiastic. If you do not say yes in a way that shows with your words and your body that you really want to have sex then that is not enthusiasm. Just laying there whilst he does whatever he wants to you is not enthusiastic.

S - Specific. Consent must be specific. If you agree to sex on a Monday, that doesn't mean you also consent to sex on a Tuesday. If you consent to taking things slowly, but instead he is rough and moves quickly, that is not consent. Let's just say that you said yes to touching his penis, and the consent you gave was valid. If he then continues to putting his penis inside of you, without you saying yes, in a way that was also valid, that is still rape. It doesn't matter if you agree to touching, agreeing to touching doesn't mean that you agree to sex. 

I know that all of this sounds like alot, but let's apply it to what happened to you. Consent is always reversible and specific. You agreed to protected sex, you did not agree to be choked, held down, raped and used for his pleasure. 

You are allowed to change your mind too. You may have said yes, but the moment you say no, consent is withdrawn. Anything after that no is rape. It is his responsibility to ensure that he is with it enough to recognise if you want to stop. 

Everything you have said about what happens makes me say that this was rape. You are not at fault. He is. He is the one that violated your trust, hurt you and broke the law. Rape or sexual assult is never the victims fault, it is always the perpetrators.

You have options here. If you want to report what happened you can, and most places have specialist systems in place to support you through that. If you don't want to report it, that is your choice, you are in control here. Who you tell and what you tell is up to you. You can still access healthcare/support without making a report. Depending on when this happened, there are tests that you can get. All you need to tell them is that you have had unprotected sex, and how long ago it was, and need to be checked out. Some STIs can go un noticed for years so it's a good idea to get checked out. You can even tell them what actually happened and they will still leave it up to you what happens next.

Please make sure you are talking to someone about what happened to you.It will take time to come to terms with what happened to you, but the fact that you are talking about it and are beginning to acknowledge that something non consential could have happened is an amazing start. Dont try to handle this alone. I'm always here if you need to talk, just send me a message. 

Ultimately you have a choice here, you are in control. You can crumble and let society tell you that you are worthless, or you can choose hope, and have faith that things will get better.

I choose hope, and I hope you do too. ❤️",2,False

1cp7wgi,,0,[deleted],"This sounds like SA/rape to me. A lot of people consider any form of penetration (including fingers) to be rape, but if it feels less horrible to you you could also consider it SA. 

- right before anything started, it sounds like he was being sexually aggressive to you. This isn't just bad flirting or sex jokes gone a bit too far - this is sexual harrassment in my opinion. It sounds like SH to me b/c of the repeated, incessant manner of it, and the forcefulness of tone. 

Part 1

1. You went to his car where he acted in a frightening manner - shouting, punching the steering wheel etc. While I understand that he was going through a lot of emotions, this probably also distressed you to the point that you probably would have felt afraid to say no later on. I know that I would, if I was trapped in a car with someone in that frame of mind. 

2. Him being in that distressed state of mind probably meant that you didn't feel you could say no either - you tend to feel you have to hug/comfort someone when they're in that state, even if you don't want to. 1 + 2 means that you were unable to freely give consent (even if you had wanted to). 

3. He NEVER asked for consent. Hugging someone to comfort them is not in any way shape or form a non verbal cue that you consent, by the way in case you worried about that! That's just you being a kind person and hugging him. 

4. Even if you had 'consented' to kissing him (which you didn't), consent should be given at every stage. He did not ask to finger you, it sounds like he just did it. This is completely inappropriate. Fingering someone is a massive stage up from kissing them, there HAS to be consent there.  

5. Even if there had been consent up to all these stages, if you said 'it hurts', as soon as he heard this he should have stopped. Immediately. He did not. 

  
Part 2

This is clear sexual assault to me. He did it when you were alone in an aisle, so no one else could see. He did it without consent, again. 

  
I am so sorry you experienced this. I'm really glad that you got away from that friendship, he doesn't sound like a safe person. I think it's truly amazing that you confronted him about his behaviours, and it just shows what an immature person he is that he couldn't even own up to his actions and apologise. I don't know if this helps, but in many countries SA charities offer free SA therapy. The waiting list is quite long, but I would really recommend.",3,False

1cp4p10,,0,Upstairs_Ad6319,"Okay first things first, here's the basics of consent. 

There is something called the FRIES acronym. It states that unless all of these conditions are met, sex or sexual activity is not sex, it is rape or assult. Someone used it to explain to me why what happened to me was rape. Since I've been in this sub I use this alot to explain to people why what happened to them wasn't okay.

So for consent to be valid it must meet the following conditions. 

FRIES stands for -

F - Freely given. If you have to pester someone for consent, ask them over and over again, tell them that if they loved you they would sleep with you, then consent is not freely given, you manipulated them into giving it.
R - Reversable. If you say yes, but then by the time you've made it to the bedroom you change your mind, then you can withdraw that consent. If you are having sex, and you change your mind, the minute you say no, or stop, consent has been withdrawn. If he forces you after that or doesn't stop immediately, then that is rape.
I - Informed. Consent must be informed consent. That means that you should know all of the potential risks and benefits of that activity. If you do not know that by having sex with someone you could catch an STD that they know they have, then that was not informed consent.
E - Enthusiastic. There should be absolutely no questioning wether you want to take part in sexual activity. If you do not say, 'Oh! Yes please, that would be lovely!' but instead you are saying 'Urgh. Go on then.'that is not enthusiastic.
S - Specific. Consent must be specific. If you agree to sex on a Monday, that doesn't mean you also consent to sex on a Tuesday. If you consent to taking things slowly, but instead he is rough and moves quickly, that is not consent.

I know it sounds complicated, but in your case it's pretty simple. It doesn't matter if you agreed to have sex with him, because you agreed only to have protected sex with him. Consent has to be specific. You didn't consent to unprotected sex, and sex without consent is always rape.

You've done the smart thing by getting tested. Please stay away from this man. If he's violated your trust once, he will do it again. 

If you want to, you can get support in reporting this to the police, there are lots of charities who provide guidance to people who have been assaulted. It is completely your choice.

I am so sorry that this happened to you. It was not your fault. Your feelings are completely valid. Things will get better.",1,False

1ck1gl7,,0,[deleted],"You didn't say no- but you didn't say 'yes' either. Saying 'yes' doesn't have to be verbal, sure, but it does have to be clear. E.g. a nvbl cue that you were into it would have been you leaning into him, reciprocal action. Kissing and touching him back. Talking with him, laughing with him. You just silently lying/standing there is not consent - that's a freeze response and totally normal for people who are being assaulted. I froze during my assault and didn't technically say 'no', that doesn't mean it wasn't assault. My body language was clear and explicit: it sounds like yours was too. Furthermore,  it wasn't like you'd been talking with him loads and shown clear sexual interest in him. You basically ghosted him after going on a date with him, it's pretty obvious you weren't interested. 

  
There's also the issue of you being extremely drunk. You were so drunk you said you found it hard to sit up - it doesn't sound like Jim was that drunk, meaning that he would have been able to tell more easily that you were incapacitated. If you are drunk, and the person feeling you up is more sober than you, there is an inherent power dynamic there as you are in a more vulnerable position than they are. It is also harder for you to consent if you are very drunk.

  
I am so sorry this happened to you. To me, it is very clear that you weren't consenting - you didn't interact with him at all, you didn't kiss him back. As you said yourself, you just 'sat there'. I'm so sorry this happened to you, and it definitely counts as SA in my opinion.",3,False

Please do not clam up, or flip out. It will take time to process but you will get better. It was not you, it was not personal. Over time the pain will yield. This too shall pass.

Then there's the fact that the absence of a no, is never a yes. Consent must be very clear and enthusiastic. There must not be any ambiguity. You didn't say no, but that doesn't mean yes. 

What happened to you was wrong and there is no hierarchy here. I do not get to feel more broken by what happened, because he put his penis in my vagina and your attacker didn't. I don't get to feel more worthy of sympathy because my attacker almost killed me. We were all assaulted, we all had our control and agency taken away, the specifics don't matter, we all deserve better.

1c8kn7f,,0,[deleted],"YES this is SA. It’s a red flag from the start that he wanted to smoke with a 16 year old, tf? I’m 21 and when my flatmates 16 y o sister came to stay at our flat for the weekend, I viewed her as a kid (bc she is one)- we cooked her dinner, and tried to show her the city. We didn’t drink or smoke with her bc we’re adults and she’s a kid! We felt a sense of parental duty to her! 

Not only this, but this man seems like he had sex in mind from the start, which is why he gave you weed, I guess to make you a bit ‘looser’ and in the mood. 

All of these red flags aside, he deliberately ignored your explicit verbal consent, multiple times. I am so sorry this happened to you. 

Personally I think that yes, you should report him. He gave drugs to a 16 y o and sexually assaulted you.

1bandlv,,0,TheNumbersSevenTwo,"Situations like this are why enthusiastic consent of all parties involved is the only way to ensure that nobody feels violated. Assuming consent is negligent and dangerous even if it isn’t malicious or selfishly motivated. You were involved in sexual acts that you did not consent to. That is sexual assault.

&gt; He started to try and make me do sexual acts on him. I never said outright no, but with my body language I pulled back and he tried to pull me in again. At that point I think I gagged and he stopped.

I’m reading in between the lines here so please correct me if I’m assuming what happened wrong, but this sounds to me like he was trying to put something in your mouth. Lack of enthusiasm on your part would be very easy to identify in this situation; there are a lot of things you can do with your mouth, and if the only thing you were doing was pulling away and gagging when forced, you are signaling with very obvious red flags; him doing anything else with you after that point is grossly negligent assuming his best possible intentions.

Even if someone is struggling with defining rape or sexual assault, it should be completely unambiguously clear that you are not comfortable with what happened, that your partner pulled you along through sexual activity that you did not enjoy that you definitely did not say “yes” to, a situation where a single moment of empathy on his part to ask if you were comfortable and ready would have stopped the whole thing. Whatever anyone wants to call it, you emotions are real and they’re valid; empathy is a skill, and part of that skill is understanding how people feel without getting hung up on definitions or semantics, or minimizing the impact your emotions have on you.",2,False

1b4fri5,,0,TheNumbersSevenTwo,"This is very problematic. Asking someone to use a condom strongly implies permission to have penetrative sex in ordinary circumstances, but you did not want to have sex. You also affirmed comfort during sexual activity that you were not comfortable with. If your partner was not aware of your experience with SA, he could very well have reasonably assumed that you would protest to unwanted sexual activity, and telling him that you were okay strongly affirms that assumption. I believe that any sexual activity with a new partner which begins without enthusiastic consent is dubious at best and this is no exception, but if there was not a boundary in place to be violated, it is harder to call this sexual assault.

However, that doesn’t make this issue any less serious. This is something harmful to you, and if well-meaning people can hurt you unknowingly, then the world becomes a much more dangerous place. I don’t know how to help you find the motivation to stand up for yourself, but causing harm to a survivor of abuse is something that many people very actively want to avoid, and to protect yourself from being harmed by those people, you simply have to find the courage to tell them that you are hurting.",1,False

Is this something that happened before the incident you described in the original post, or after? If this happened before, it gives me more context about what was going on.

In any case, it is good that you are becoming comfortable with communicating boundaries. After having an experience with someone where boundaries and communication meant nothing, it is understandable for you to have to learn how boundaries can actually be helpful. Sex can be purely enjoyable for two people to experience together, and boundaries and communication are how people achieve that. Boundaries and communication are also how you avoid sexual experiences that you do not want and are not comfortable with. Keep this in mind while you practice setting boundaries, because accomplishing something helpful by setting boundaries is how you can learn that you have real meaningful power to improve this aspect of your life.",1,False

The psychiatrist can prescribe you some medicine if needed and should be able to lead tou to other proffessional able to help you more (only problem is that it's probably cost a lot of money and there is a lot of chance that he/she have to explain everything to your parent). The therapist is able to explain everything about how your brain react and how to cope or treat this, he also know some technique to help you thinking less to what bothering you.

From her side though if you promised not to beg for sex and kept asking her and penetrated her without consent drunk or not it’s still assault.

did he have a *reason* for acting that way? yeah. does that make him a good person who deserved as many chances as i gave him? no.

I put off leaving him for so long, and even when i did i didn't make it feel final. i stayed in contact with him for like 3+ months after. but eventually I realized some people may have good at their hearts but that doesn't make them good people. yes they need some growing up to do but they can do that growing away from you, away from hurting you.

A sex assault sorry doens't go away from the neural networks holding the memories of it  in the body &amp; mind . It is submerged &amp; 'forgotten ' enough usually for the victim then  to move enough forward that is all  in life .  Victim's will either have protective factors present to help them cope in life ( with the attack ) as it seems you did for awhile . Or will decline into self destructive mode to try &amp; cope but also NOT cope  at all with it .

The submergence will be re-booted if you have a neural stimuli activation occurring . ( which you did ) .For you this was the internal exam &amp;  that initial 'touch ' on you . It happens it is normal to occur for a victim &amp; sorry it can be re-triggered even when you are older. As sorry that is ingrained truama ( it sticks around  haunting someone)  .

It will remain there always  but it can be lessoned via coping strategies to help you 'control the reactional triggering responses  that are occurring ( when it does ) . The only way around it is now to know of your trigger points  that might set you off. Some will be worse than other triggers responses ( some will trigger panic or somatic responses ) in the mind or body , &amp; others might  just set off a chain biochemical -reaction of possible mind dissociation .

&gt;have no right because people have been through way worse and I’m taking the attention away from the “real” victims.

A victim is a victim . It lays down truama in the person with any kind of sex attack . Yes some are way more severe (  they do indeed need alot of therapy to get them out of it ) . But even minor SA or even a gentle r\*pe **is still TRAUMA** , It is laid down the same in the mind &amp; bodies memory storage systems . Hense why your reactional state of such distress was triggered so badly . As **it was that bad to YOU** . Trauma is individualised , &amp;it's severity will depend on alot of individualised factors . Hense why 2 people who experienced exactly the same truama will handle it differently . As they are diff people.   All violence  against someone  will lay that  truama down into  the mind &amp; body ( in storage ) due to it.

&gt;It has been two years and it’s not something I’ve thought too much about recently. But now it’s all I can think about. It feels like the assault just happened, like it’s currently, actively still happening to me

I'm sorry you opened a mind neural loop with that stored truama on it ( it's always there ) via the stimuli network being re-activated within you . YOur mind &amp; body needs to re-learn how to re-calm yourself back down into a more calmer state again . As yes it is rushed into mind consciousness for you again to re-live it . It doesn't take much to do sorry . Hense why knowing this is a triggering point for you is good to know now . Active re-engaging with the truama loop by helping it to be soothed again will help .

* **Seek out a trauma therapist** to help if possible.
* **Journaling** might be also of some help by getting out all right now down onto paper or talking it out loud ( in private ) .Couple this with the right affirmations &amp; somatic mind exercises to help you get back on track.
* Practicing somatic (exercises) -with new settings for your mind &amp; body might also be of help . YOur sense of safety has been shaken internally &amp; mentally right now.",2,False

While I understand why you feel it might be easier to just “go with it” instead of telling him the truth and risk disappointing him I think that would be a bad idea. Firstly, if he’s your friend he should understand and not pressure you. And second, you don’t know how you might react to sex in your current headspace and you won’t know until it’s happening. You could dissociate which might leave him feeling like he did something wrong or wasn’t good enough. You might get emotional or cry during or afterwards (I’ve been there and it’s embarrassing in the moment, but easier to manage when my partner knows ahead of time that it has nothing to do with them). There are so many things that could happen during/after sex when we are already feeling triggered and I think letting him know ahead of time would be the responsible thing to do to avoid any misunderstandings or hurt feelings. You can also let him know what might be comforting to you ahead of time if you do get emotional or dissociate if you do choose to have sex. Sometimes it can be difficult to explain in the moment so I’ve found that my partner can help more when I tell him beforehand.

In your case, it sounds like it may have exceeded what was even allowed and crossed into sexual assault, though I can say that even when it is within what is allowed by search procedure, it can still be traumatizing.

The procedure in the U.S. is kept a closely guarded secret that TSA refuses to disclose for security reasons, but when TSA developed it, [TSA even sent a memorandum to all airport police departments warning that people will be reporting their experiences as sexual assault due to how invasive the search requirements are](https://viewfromthewing.com/tsa-reaching-police-convince-new-screening-procedures-arent-sexual-assault/). That's absolutely terrible and wrong. And that's only if it's limited to what it is supposed to be and not beyond what is allowed.

That have been cases when people going through the checkpoint have been subjected to searches beyond what is allowed, which crosses into sexual assault. That is certainly possible and unfortunately has happened. It is incredibly traumatizing when someone in a position of authority does this to someone.

If you trust this new tattoo artist I think you should go back and ask to meet with them privately and confide this experience to them. They might have resources that can help you. The scarring shows how vulnerable you were and yes, he DID violate you and he deliberately cut into you as he was doing this. You need to get pictures of the scarring with someone you trust, get a statement from your doctor, from the tattoo artist as well, and if nothing else, this new artist might help get them blacklisted from the community.

i was raped 4 years ago and still get panic attacks or cry during sex. sometimes it’s because of fear, but other times it’s because that sense of safety with someone who actually respects you and asks for consent is so overwhelming. the man you’re with now is treating you with the gentleness you deserve and it’s going to take time to accept and be comfortable with that. just be open with him about this, as you’re ready. he sounds like he’s more than willing to walk with you in the healing journey

15v25n8,,0,Broken_doll4,"&gt;I received oral herpes and genital herpes from him

If this boy gave this to YOU . Then he was a victim of oral  r\*pe ( or more )  then at some point  poss as well . And would say this was why he was also involving you in sex activity  . As He ***himself was also a victim*** of SA &amp; r\*pe from most likely an adult at some point or  it was on-going. NO child gets a STD without sex attack usually at such  a VERY young age   ( so  he started with you as a very young child also ) getting you involved . This is most likely the reason why he got you involved ( as he also ***thought it was normal to do ) as he himself was being sex attacked*** &amp; was just repeating the behaviours  with you  ( As NOPe at that age he would NOT have had ANY idea what  he was doing either in regards to sex  ( so yep he would of been also a child victim at some point ) or was being sex attacked reg also . Which **makes him a victim** ( of CSA &amp; r\*Pe ) &amp; was also a **sex abuser** of another child as well . His fault ( &amp; also not ) as this boy was also so young . 

It can happen when a victim also becomes a **NOT knowing abuser** also ( causing a ***cycle of abuse to start*** to occur like this )  btw children ( you may not have also been the only child forced or coursed into it by him . Where another child is involved  ( COCSA) in sex activity ( where they should NOT have been at all )  it can make both victim's &amp; abusers of other children  ( eg- you also could of gone on to abuse other kids ) or got them involved to do it ( as it can have this effect to like it &amp; want others involved in it also )  . **He would NOT have understood  at all** ( just like you NOT to do it )  At 10. He was VERY much a young abused child as well.

&gt;The issue is that I was reciprocal to the sexual activity and sometimes even initiated it which makes me feel so disgusted because what 6 year old does that? I also did not really know what sex was and the importance of it; I guess the only reason why I did not stop was because it “felt good”.

This often can happen where the victim's become interested in how it makes them feel ( eg- sex is meant to feel good but just **NOT at that age** ) . NO one under 16 should ever be having ANY kind of sex activity . As yep the mind is in NO way ready to handle it . It leaves the child or teen in truama instead from it . So yep the instigating of it &amp; joining in can occur with kids into to sex activity at a WAY to young of a age  .

It should never have occurred but did . It cannot be changed now . Kids exposed to sex activity or porn at a very young age ( can become addicted to the activities of it ) just like an adult . They then can't handle it &amp; become out of control with it ( eg- seek it out , look for it &amp; enjoy it ) leaving them in a hyperarousal state of the want for it . That is  one of the ramifications of it eg- to leave the child in a vulnerable , confused state from it . As their mind &amp; body can crave it but they also can hate it also at the same time as well. Causing the shame &amp; guilt associated with it . As kids grow up &amp; then comes to terms with what they have done &amp; it always then causes on-going mental issues.

With boys also engaging in same sex activities it can also cause on-going sexual ID orientation issues also . As they have engaged in sex activity with the same sex when ( they mighen have even been that way orientated ) to begin with ( as yep it was coursed or was forced on them to engage in the sex activities ) . Again another layer of mental issues then for the person. NOt to also mention you have the issue also that this was someone in the family also . ( when it is also someone YOU know ) that causes also then again yet another layer of issues for the child / teen victim ) .

&gt;I am also very disgusted with this “family friend” because the maturity and intellectual difference between a 6 and 10 year old is quite great and he continued to pursue sexual activity with me until he was around 12/13.

Again NO 10 yr old is responsible either ( It might have been from abuse or watching porn ) maybe . He at that age **would NOT have understood the ramifications** of it  at all ( way to young ) . When older he would of ( maybe over 12)  MOST kids don't understand mentally it is even wrong by 12 ( till they get sex ed ) poss . It might have dawned it was wrong to do to you , Or to get you involved ( or he really might have been oblivious to it ) .But that still doesn't take away from your pain by him into it to you . It should NOT have occurred but NO he wouldn't have understood NOT to also do it to you at that age of 10.

But by then it was to late for you both . YOu were use to doing it tog by then ( there was coercion being used at first but then yes you would seem then have been also involved from what you said ( it happens at times ) where they child gets to use to it &amp; does &amp; come to enjoy it also ( when they should NOT in any way ) NOT your fault at that age at  all . And would of both sought it yes it out NOT knowing or understanding why it should not be occurring . By 13  he might have known ( but NOt all do though ) . If a victim himself from abuse he might have been TOLD  it was normal . And yep that is enough to f\*ck up a young person's mind to think it is ok .

&gt;I know there is no cure for herpes but is there some medication available that may treat symptoms? Also how do pursue romantic relationships in the future with this disease?

Yes a DR can help you with treatment for it . By 16 ( depending where you live ) you should be able to seek treatment without your parents being notified . Ask the DR ( if they have to tell your parents or not ) at 16 . Then you can get treatment or ask the questions you need to from them . But also remember this was NOT your fault you were a child when you got it . YOu had NO say in it , &amp; NO control over getting it either. Just like the other boy prob also had NO say in having it . ( it was also prob forced on him as well ) .

YOu do **have a moral &amp; health obligation to inform a partner of your herpes ( before you have intimacy or sex with them )** It is a STD  . As no NOT everyone would want it ( &amp; should NOT be given it )  **without talking about it FIRST before sex activity ( you do OWE them that )**  . A condom being used can help to prevent cross -infection . Read up on it online much info nowdays about it to prevent spreading it to a potential partner. Many do have relo's with someone ( &amp; their partner does NOT have it &amp; they just use protection &amp; precautions to prevent spreading it to them ) .  But **YOU do have a moral &amp; health obligation to NOT give it to someone else knowing this**   ( as all it requires is communication with a potential new  partner  )  about it ( they then they can decide for themselves or not to be with you )  sexually / intimately ( not to tell someone ) is lying .

But it can be managed nowdays much better for people with it. And many people do live with it . And you can also always date someone with it ( &amp; not have to worry about giving it to them ) . It is VERY common ( but is NOT harmless ) . It is a long life condition currently . So hense why you are obligated to tell someone first before having sex with them ( to prevent them getting it ) just like ANY STD  .",1,False
15v25n8,Broken_doll4@0,1,Throwaway-983762,"hey there thank you for replying.

I never really considered if he was also a victim but it also may have been he just received coldsores from an outside source (e.g. him kissing a school gf who had it at the time) although im not completely dismissing your point, he very well could have also been a victim of SA before me to which im very disturbed and saddened about.

also he may be in denial about his sexual orientation because hes against gay people (at least people associated with him being gay) despite his past and has constantly talked down to me because im “not man enough” or im “too feminine”

An additional note is that me and siblings were exposed to inappropriate content that showed topics such as masterbation from a very young age which lead to the coping of said behaviours. ig maybe he saw sex from a video or movie or something and wanted to test it out??? idk

honestly this whole situation is too much for me but i think my next steps are to visit a sexual health doctor and see what can be done and to visit a therapist when i start working",1,True
15v25n8,Throwaway-983762@1,2,Broken_doll4,"&gt;I never really considered if he was also a victim but it also may have been he just received coldsores from an outside source

A 10 yr old would have to either experienced oral r\*pe  ( to know how to do it ) or would have had to have seen sex ( eg- parents doing it ) or watched porn ( where it showed this ) . A child of **10 does NOT know how to do it** nor would they want to  ( **unless they are exposed to it** ( kissing does NOT mean anything  at all ( unless that gal child did it to him bc of her OWN sex attacks --&gt; this is also possible ) the child to know how to have sex would have to have been sex attacked or watched it ( to know how to do it ) . As mentioned the cycle of making victim's &amp; perps ( other children ) is a VERY sad thing  . As just ONE child ( who is sex attacked ) can then make more victim's &amp; perps  ( eg- out of 6 kids he or she might sex attack or encourage to do sex activities  with them some of them then will also then turn out to continue on ( with other new children ) they will bring into the sex circle of making new victim's &amp; perps of other children  ..

It is / can be **a horrific cycle for kids who are victim's of sex attacks .** As during the grooming cycle of attacking a child ( the poor child is told all sorts of s\*it  as well  -&gt; all kinds of lies ) to make them think it is normal ( &amp; to shut them up about it ) to do it to them . ( the groomer does it so they don't get caught eg--an adult attacking a  child ) . Will groom them into thinking it is ok to do , &amp; it's normal etc ) . So then thinking it is ok ( they then go onto other kids getting them involved into it ) . YOu could of been the same ( eg- watching porn at a young age ruins the child's mind ) . It can often make them hypersexual &amp; yes then go on to make other kids do also sex activities with them ( bc they don't know they should not do it ) or do it bc they come to like it to much &amp; are essential addicted to the feelings of it ) eg- the pleasure release of it .

&gt;honestly this whole situation is too much for me but i think my next steps are to visit a sexual health doctor and see what can be done and to visit a therapist when i start working

Yes good idea ( even though you liked it &amp; may have even been initiating it ) YOu were still a child being into to sex activity . Which I'm so sorry yes leaves  deep truama  &amp; on-going mental issues .  Bc when the child of sex actiity grows up -&gt; there is all this left over effects of ramifications for them to some how deal with . Eg- ( for you having o\*al sex with another boy ) having sex &amp; seeing porn at a very young age . And there will be on-going stress &amp; anxiety around the thoughts of it . It leaves deep ridges also of sexual confusion also with young people also exposed to the same sex as well. ( As it mighten as mentioned have even been your orientation or his ) . But it was done &amp; cannot be changed now . 

So the victim' of very young sex activity will be left in deep confusion over it , guilt , regret , &amp; have stress &amp; anxiety from it ( eg - also with you comes now also the on-going health issues also bc of it ) . Kids sex attacked or encouraged also often can have on-going mental issues from it eg- , depression, anxiety disorders , s\*cial tendencies &amp; attempts  , &amp; eating disorders or self harm , &amp; hypersexuality issues , dangerous activity involvement - &gt; Eg- drugs or / &amp; alcohol or porn addiction , attention seeking out behaviours which are out of control  -&gt;Eg- seeking out people online to engage into sex activity  ( eg- doing it when under age ) &amp;  engaging pedo's .

For him also to have a STD it ( was most likely an adult ) who attacked him in the beginning ( to also have been left with a STD). Children do NOT have  sexually transmitted STD's ( unless they have been sex attacked by someone ) against their OWN will  .",2,False

The worst part is, my parents know about it, I told them with my innocence(at that point I didn’t know what it was) but now that I am 22, it’s causes me a lot of discomfort. Like a lot. Unfortunately, right now I have to live with my parents, and he lives with us too, just this morning I was making tea for myself and he entered and made his coffee, my whole day has been ruined, his presence makes my want to throw up. He treated me like a object, I sometimes wonder if he still thinks of me like that. And that thought makes me uncomfortable, my self image is so bad. It shows in my posture and in the way I speak.
It is extremely painful for people like us, to go through this, siblings have a relationship for a lifetime. I really resent this whole situation a lot. It feels like a dirty patch on me. I feel dirty. I have a difficult time in getting comfortable around men in general, because someone who was a primary blood relative saw me as an object and treated me like one.

If I were you I would genuinely reconsider your relationship and also most definitely call off the wedding because you are walking to a lifelong commitment with someone who has zero respect for boundaries especially boundaries like these and you’re also possibly giving him an excuse to commit marital rape as laws are more lenient when it comes to spousal rape a lot of the times.

This person was 18 &amp; a predator of you . You were groomed into a position to be sexually attacked by him . He should be in jail ( as you were just over a child's age) . You were way to young &amp; were so easily manipulated by a 18 yr old. He was always going to SA you or worse . ***Yes it was SA any thing he did that was of a sexual nature to YOU or enticed you to do to him . And If he had sex with you it was r\*pe .***

You both should not have been dating . It was a huge mistake you were even talking to him. He was always going to try &amp; have sex with you . Or do some kind of sex activity . There was NO other reasons to engage you . YOu were just over the age of a child ( a normal 18 yr old would have found no interest in you ) . But he did bc that was all that was on his mind was to have sex with you .

&gt;i thought it was okay, people around me didn't warn me so i really thought it was okay. he was graduating for fuck's sake and i was getting promoted to 10th grade. it's been 5 years now and i still get flashbacks, it makes me panic and i have been sexually assaulted before, it all comes back every now and then in huge waves and makes me feel terrible.

Yep you will be left with truama from him &amp; his interactions with you . As he was an adult at 18 trying to manipulate a very young person into sex activity . You were easy prey for this perp to enable him to sex attack you . As soon as you started to talk to him he had YOU trapped in his web. YOu were way to young to understand the s\*t storm you were in ( most your age would not have had a clue ) how manipulative this guy was going to be with you . YOu were way in over your head with an adult ( who ONLY had intentions of trying to get in your pants . He had NO other reason to even talk to you ( as normal adults ) who are NOT predators would NOT peruse someone so young . As they have nothing in common.

And a person who is NOT a predator would never date a 13 yr old . It is way to young , &amp; they do ONT have the mental capacity to even understand what they are doing in a relo  . It would have been very one sided relo , &amp; totally deceptive of you as a person . Hense why adults are NOT allowed to date young kids &amp; teens as they do NOT have the capacity to even fully understand what a relo is . And they are so in a **power imbalance** with an adult . Hense why it is illegal to date / have sex with a child or teen ( to try &amp; protect them from disgusting perverts ) who will ONLY use them for their own benefit  &amp; will use coercion/ pressuring practices  on them , or will jsut sex attack them ( as it is over for them before they even realize what is about to occur for the child or young teen ) TRAPPED with a disgusting perv predator .",1,False

His actions are the ones that will/would bring about consequences. I also agree with you that the law prob couldn't do much of anything about a thigh touch. But it's still definitely inappropriate. I'm 33 and personally could not imagine being sexually interested in anyone who is 5 years younger than me. That age gap is soooo much bigger when people are in their teens, ya know? Like, I highly, highly doubt this dude didn't know she was underage because 14 year olds look 14. The upper thigh is extremely intimate, usually not a place people are comfortable touching on another unless they've already done some sort of sexual activity with them. Like if I was on a date and a person I've never even kissed put their hand on my UPPER THIGH I would be freaked out and extremely uncomfortable; that is mere inches away from someone's most personal body parts. Being called out, as you said, I think would be a very good step to take (I also think you should tell a trusted adult). Pay attention to how he responds to the call out too...

13ga79l,,0,BeenRightfullyStolen,"Maybe some of these things will apply to your thought process or help.

You can be victimized and traumatized even if you feel like your experience wasn't as bad as other people's. Labeling yourself a victim or calling your experience assault does not detract from anyone else's experiences with assault. This isn't a zero sum game, and there's room for anyone who has been adversely affected by coercive/nonconsensual sexual experiences or experiences where they were misled or lied to about key information that affects consent. There is a broad spectrum of experiences that fall into SA, and they are ALL SA.

A lot of people don't like or aren't comfortable using the word victim, and that's ok. A lot of people prefer to call themselves survivors. A friend of mine said just the other day that she doesn't like either, as someone who has both experienced abuse and beaten cancer. In her words, ""I think people can experience trauma without it defining them."" If there's another word you want to use, or there is (now or ever) a healthy reason you don't want to use victim, then do what feels right for you. It sounds like right now at least, it isn't a healthy reason, but over time that can change, which is ok.

Which brings me to the last point: healing is a journey, and labeling your experiences and how you identify yourself in their context is a piece of that journey. Sometimes, you have to accept where you are, because if you focus on how far you still have to go, you'll minimize the progress you've already made. It's a good idea to pause and reflect periodically. It can help you decide how you want to move forward. You might also decide some of your survival tactics that got you to that point aren't helping anymore, and then you can let them go or repurpose them. That includes labels.

Sometimes, you don't necessarily have to do anything specific to build your comfort level with words, it just takes time. About 9 months ago, my now ex used the word ""rape"" to describe what he did. I think I have said that word out loud twice or maybe 3 times in reference to that experience, and every time has been quoting him. I've only said it to him, my therapist, and maybe a friend who was literally in the other room when it happened and who I'd already told what happened way before the label. I'm getting there. Talking about all of the things he put me through gets easier with distance and time, especially if I focus on how it affects me now.

Also, trauma-focused or trauma-informed therapy can be helpful for situations where you feel a cognitive dissonance like this. It can be a sign that you have learned thought processes or beliefs about yourself and your experiences that will fall apart if challenged the right way, ""right"" being dependent on the particular thought process or belief. I personally did cognitive processing therapy, and even though I ""graduated"" from that method about 5 years ago, I still use the tools I learned very often. I also still see a therapist regularly for traditional talk therapy.",2,False

13ga79l,brel1654@1,2,BeenRightfullyStolen,"It's totally normal to be overwhelmed, and there's no standard timeline for where you need to be and when. Only share what you're ready to at any given moment. If a therapist asks you a question you aren't ready to answer, or if you get to a point and can't say any more, ""I'm not ready to get into that"" is an acceptable answer. Pressuring yourself too much can have several different unintended consequences. Every step, no matter how small or insignificant it feels, is progress to be proud of. Try to give yourself some grace.

You can ""pressure"" yourself in a healthy way. There's a difference between wanting/needing to process something specific but having anxiety over it and not being ready to process it. For me, I can usually tell the difference by talking around it, usually to myself at first. If talking around something without going into detail helps me give more detail, then I figure I probably am ready. If I talk around it and just freak out more, I'm probably not. You might have another method that works better, but I think finding a way to differentiate is really helpful.

Good luck, especially with finding a therapist you click with. If you have a few sessions and you don't like them, you can look for someone else. We don't always find the right one the first time, and it isn't always the therapist's fault. Sometimes you just don't have the kind of connection you need for it to work well, and they tend to be really understanding of that.",2,False

I know that can feel confusing because you actively partook in what was happening, but coerced consent is not consent. My ex did this same thing to me and I am so sorry that this happened to you. It’s so hard when someone who is supposed to care for you bulldozes your boundaries and then manipulates you into believing that things are your fault. They take your emotional connection and manipulate it against you so that they can have control. They cannot or will not take accountability and instead find it easier to put it all on you. That doesn’t mean that’s true, it just means they’re fucked up and unwilling to face themselves. 

You are not dumb. My ex was emotionally manipulative towards me for two years during our relationship. She took, took, took and did not care about my limits or boundaries.

121uy0w,,0,DirtyBee4,"If some one performed a sexual act on or to you while you were passed out then yes, that is possible assault or rape. Male or female it doesn’t matter. If enthusiastic consent is not given then it is SA. Now, if you want to go to the courts with this it is a long process and there will be a lot of here-say, but that is always your decision to make.

  There is always the possibility that nothing actually happened except you were scammed out of $400. The likelihood is pretty high. 

 Best advice is to go get checked for any STD or STI right away. Then there is medical record that either she gave you one or you gave her one. Then you can go file a report. This situation you may find some people won’t believe you or assumed you should have just enjoyed it, and it’s the sad truth for both men and women. If you do end up going to court there should be CCTV footage in the area or room the stripper took you to. Most clubs have security cameras even in private rooms to make sure nothing bad happens to the strippers. 

  More than anything I would get tested by a doctor, and then start seeing a therapist. Don’t feel bad if you can’t remember to many details. For some people whatever happens never comes back to them, and for others it can take years. Therapy will help you learn to deal with all the feelings you may have from what happened and help you to not then project them onto whomever you have an intimate relationship with.

  Whatever you decide to do I hope you find peace, and I hope you can find ways to be safe from getting in a situation like that again.",5,False

Hecken' hard, trust me - I know.  I felt super embarrassed and ashamed going to my mother but once I figured out what was going on, it was the right thing to do.

The key is to remember: 

YOU HAVE DONE NOTHING WRONG. 

HE HAS.  

The shame, embarrassment, and confusion you may feel are all part of dealing with and processing what happened.  Share your feelings with your trusted adult or ask to see a counselor.

Please, I'm begging you..

Talk to your trusted adult. 

If they brush you off, find and talk to another trusted adult.

If it ever happens again, find your inner strength and shout, ""STOP! I don't like it when you touch my [be specific, say where his hand is]"" and immediately find your trusted adult. 

Let me repeat this:

YOU haven't done ANYTHING wrong.

Reporting him is not doing anything wrong.

No normal adult accidentally tickles a child on their privates, especially when they have to go underneath clothing. And, commenting on your potential sex life at the dinner table was highly inappropriate and unusual. 

The person you were with when you were 18 refused to stop when you said you weren’t ready, which is when he should have stopped all contact. Kissing him back at one point is not a form of consent in that instance because he was pressuring you. Only stating “yes” without a shadow of hesitation or doubt in your mind is consent. 

Sometimes, we survivors have to educate ourselves on boundaries and consent after the fact. It’s totally normal. Please don’t be hard on yourself or blame yourself, because people can only learn what they know they need to learn, if that makes sense. From my own experience, I can say with certainty that both of these men knew exactly what they were doing in taking advantage of a young girl who hadn’t been properly prepared for certain situations in life.

105euk9,,0,kqlb700,"Hey. I wanna say first of all that I was assaulted a few times at 17 *during* a relationship with a 22 year old. I kept it to myself bc I was a very unhappy teenager who’d experienced worst sexual violence. I’m 28 now but just want you to know this is where I’m coming from here

1) what he did was attempt to rape you. He tried in more than one way: after the first no he should have stopped. But he didn’t he carried on. Ignoring a no is a very clear attempt at SA. He then tried to force you (method 2) and he continued to try coerce you (method 3). 

2) In his rejection, he tried to shame and guilt you into it. That’s method 4 and a hell of a red flag in any relationship. That’s emotionally abusive. You have a right to say no to ANYTHING. Especially intimate things you do with your body. 

3) As a 22 year old, he definitely knows what he’s done and that’s why he tried to make it seem like your fault. That’s also why he was nice to you when you returned after leaving to talk to someone - he cares more about your silence. So if you say okay and/or you’re blaming yourself, you’re too busy to focus on what he’s done *because he wanted to*. 

4) Being 22 can make you horny - just like being 17 - but it doesn’t make you try force someone you care about into a situation they don’t want to be in. There’s never a level of so horny that “no” doesn’t register. 

5) I wanna gently say oral sex doesn’t make it a “lesser” crime. oral sex is still sex and if it’s forced or coerced it’s rape. 

6) Finally I wanna say. I’m glad you feel the fingering happened naturally. You might change your mind about how you feel about that &amp; it’s ok if you enjoyed it. The rest of the shitty behaviour is still shitty. 

But as a teenager who also “traded” access to me/my body to keep others happy or not as upset, I want to express that you were put under a lot of pressure there, and this is also how sexual coercion works. It’s kinda of like bartering for a deal, like, “I can’t give you this but I can give you this” or him intending to get his top thing (penetrative sex with his penis) but settling for something ‘less’ like fingering. 

Except you’re not something to be traded. You’re a whole person with thoughts and feelings and wants and do-not-wants. 

Something that I wish I’d have heard earlier that really helped me understand consent and what had been done to me was, “Absence of a yes is a no.” 

That means unless it’s an enthusiastic yes, it’s a no. All 22 year olds know that. Hell, many of the teens and younger kids in my life do too. 

Consent isn’t modelled properly in life. &amp; this is definitely an area where people - like this guy - hope you won’t learn the truth of the situation so he can get away with whatever he wants. 

I think you’re really brave for trying to talk to people and seeking help. You deserved a lot better. &amp; there’s thousands and thousands of people in california, and some of them will *definitely* treat you better. 

This was attempted rape of a minor using emotional manipulation and coercion. 

If you want to go to the police, you should *absolutely* do that. But a teacher or an adult you trust should be able to help you with that. There’ll be local victim support groups who’ll be able to help you too if you do a Google search. &amp; any assault phone line will be able to give you anonymous advice too.

yyrnzi,,0,mis2k,"I feel ya. I just got out of a relationship with a narcissist I tried to breakup with him for 2 years and but every time I’d say I didn’t want to be together bc I was unhappy he would threaten to kill himself if we broke up, accused me of only wanting to breakup so I could sleep with other people, said that if I broke up with him it meant I never loved him and I was just using him the whole time. 

One of his issues with our relationship though was that we didn’t have sex enough and it made him feel bad about himself. I explained to him that I had no sex drive bc of the birth control. So i started having sex with him more even tho I had no sex drive and didn’t want to. I felt like if I didn’t I was a bad gf and I felt bad for always trying to breakup with him bc it hurt him. But cheated on me with my aunt bc he said I wasn’t loving enough and she felt like a “mother figure” which makes no sense like why would you wanna sleep with someone you see as a mother figure wtf. Even then I stayed with him another 6 months. 

Our mutual friends all still talk to him including one of my cousins. None of my friends would talk to me about the breakup although I’m sure they talked him through it even though he was harassing me for months calling me a whore and that he’s so much better than me. None of that matters bc everyone still thinks I’m the crazy and dramatic one.

Anyway, it’s a long road ahead of you and nothing is fair about it. I know it’s really hard but it does end up being the easiest thing is to just cut off everyone that sides with him and make some new friends. Journaling helps a lot if you don’t do that already.

yy5i4t,,0,id3amav3n,"Oh, OP. I'm sorry you're feeling so so awful. This is a really difficult thing to go through and many people struggle the same as you are. 😔

Sometimes people experience a sort of dissociation when it comes to traumatic events. Kinda like what you're describing. It doesn't FEEL like it happened to them, even tho they know it did. Sometimes people have memories of seeing themselves go through it, like an out of body experience. Others just feel really really detached from the situation. Almost like it was a dream or they were just observing what happened.

It's your brains way of protecting you and a very common experience.

So if you experienced that AND gaslighting over what happened? It's no wonder you struggling with acceptance that it happened.

None of this is your fault, OP.

It can be really difficult to seek help, I know. But guess what? You just did. 🙂 So good for you!

Baby steps, OP. You can talk about your thoughts here and you could call a crisis line for SA and just talk to them.

Eventually you can work your way up to professional help.

He physically forced you into contact with him. He pressured and begged you every step of the way. You made it clear you weren't interested in participating on either occasion even without saying no, so it wasn't mutual. Even when he could get you to stop resisting for a moment you'd still return to telling him you weren't comfortable and resisting him after just a few minutes of ""compliance"" so it wasn't continuous. You made no effort to participate, had to be coerced and forced into any of this, and even during the moments where you actually did as he said you did so unenthusiastically. You were 13, had no interest in sexual acts just yet, didn't know how to say no or escape the situation any more effectively than you did, didn't know what to expect next, and just in general really didn't have the knowledge base for informed consent to start with while his age provided him with much greater experience, strength, and control over the situation. You were sober and well rested, but you were still experiencing trauma responses like the freeze and fawn (or comply) response so you weren't lucid. You never consented either physically or verbally with any of his advances, requests, or demands and you certainly made it clear that there was a lack of consent at multiple points in this experience. There are 9 total points of consent. Missing 1 means sexual abuse. He missed all 9. 0/9 points of consent and physical contact makes this sexual assault.

This guy completely ignored how you were feeling, and overrode your signals to slow down. He was testing you the entire time, to see how far he would be able to push himself on you and how you would react. Naturally, you were in shock! You did what many people do when in a completely threatening and unexpected situation, you froze. On top of everything, it is hard as hell to think at all, let alone clearly, when in the middle of an anxiety attack, while your body is being violated. 
He was correct in stating that you had no idea of what he could do to you, and the cruelty of that statement must have been shocking later. As you said, this had been someone you once thought of as a friend, right? Guy who was cute, fun to flirt with, but never thought would hurt you in any way. For this to happen is a horrible betrayal. 

OP, there is nothing in what you have written that gives any indication of consent. Shock, confusion, immobility, fear, anxiety.. none of these things imply consent. Being physically pinned to a bed by a person, so that you cannot escape is not consent. Consent is saying “Yes”. While you are mentally, cognitively present. OP, you never in any way did this. You were assaulted, and this was in no way your fault. You did not create this situation, nor did you invite this person to strip you, trap you and assault you.

To a degree we all do this: I should not have gone there, done this or that, been with him or her. It is so hard, because it’s so irrational and untrue and harmful to our souls and we know all of this logically! But yet…
Something that is extremely helpful is to imagine that a younger friend, or a cousin, or sister perhaps, came to you filled with the same emotions you felt, and told you what you wrote. What would you say to her? 
By removing yourself from the situation, even for a brief minute, it helps you to see more clearly, and without the shadow of guilt and lingering doubt and shame, that there never was for a moment any reason for you to view yourself as anything other than an innocent harmed. It will also allow yourself to forgive yourself if that is indeed needed.

Hey girl, I’m sorry but this definitely was SA &amp; it absolutely was NOT “partly my fault”. There are many reasons why you may not have “woken up” and stopped him one of those being a freeze response in which you were too shocked/scared to think fast enough to react or your body just literally froze up on you &amp; you physically didn’t feel like you could respond to what was happening to you. It is not rare for us to not know how to react in the moment especially when it happens that fast &amp; it does not make it your fault or him any less guilty. He thought you were asleep, confirmed you were asleep by asking you &amp; then assaulted you while thinking you were passed out from alcohol or deep in sleep. That was a predatory &amp; very fucked up thing for him to do &amp; he knew it. That is why he went &amp; slept somewhere else is because he knew he had assaulted you. He obviously had a clear enough mind to make decisions &amp; know right from wrong so this cannot be blamed on the consumption of alcohol. Please I am begging you do not see this guy again. Have a friend or parent go take any stuff you have of his back speak to him &amp; let him know that he assaulted you &amp; that he is to no longer have any contact with you. Or text him &amp; say something similar or whatever will give you peace but you will not be able to keep dating this “nice guy” without constant fear &amp; panic that something might happen. He is not trustworthy &amp; that will always be in the back of your head. Please protect yourself &amp; do not continue to see him. I am so sorry you are going through this &amp; I am thankful you have your friends there to support you. Calling a SA support line &amp; talking to them could help you decide what to do. You could definitely go to the hospital &amp; report it if you feel comfortable with that (at least have them take samples &amp; then you can decide if you want to press charges later) if you decide to do that try not to shower or wash your hands till you go. But it is understandable if you don’t want to go through that, I just hope you will start seeing a counselor to work through this trauma.

You don't owe her real or full explanation, but since you worry that she might not have thought you were serious, it is worth taking a deliberate moment that you would like her te respect your boundaries on this. If she wants someone to talk to about sex or make rape jokes with, she better dump that on someone else.

Maybe she'll slip up, but at least you're sure you were absolutely clear on your boundaries, and if she doesn't feel bad abot crossing them then it might be best to find another roommate.

ws6x2k,,0,Broken_doll4,"&gt;But how can I really be a victim when I hadn’t had any trauma until now? How can I be a victim when I never said no or enjoyed it?

You would have had trauma from it that is why you didn't remember it maybe at all , or your body will and your mind won't as a child ( the anxiety / pain / fear ) will be stored in the body and can then present in the child as major trauma issues eg- depression / acting out behaviors , development of anxiety , sucidial tendencies , eating disorders etc, etc  . The mind suppresses it for the child to cope with the unwanted  sexual attacks. You were a child , very scared of him and what he was doing to you . So it causes many diff emotions and body feelings in the child to have to experience such abuse at such a young age. So the mind of the child will suppress the thoughts of it ( till the child is older and can handle better the info of it ). Each time the child experiences an attack most kids will dissociate from their body to cope ( especially so a child who is reg assaulted ) . Eg - body there, mind gone . The memories will resurface once the victim is older and able to cope with the trauma memories / flashbacks.

Children under 12 will NOT  say no most of the time with an adult ( most are just s\*it to scared to move let alone do or say  anything else ) most would freeze up in fear as well with an adult automatically ( even if an adult is known )  as they are being forced to perform for an adult against their will ( it is  NO diff for a child ) to an adult woman attacked except the child's mind will automatically suppress it .

Hense why pedo's get away with it , as the child will dissociate due to pain , fear and the release of chemicals rushing into the little bodies it will send them into a state of mental &amp; body shock . Depending on the child they might dissociate that first time of assault or will automatically each time then they are attacked by the pedo . The mind will be on high vigilant alert and will do it for the child to help them cope with  it all each time they are attacked by the perp  . It **is a trauma response being produced in the child** which also will result in mind suppression of the abuse also enough, also for then the child to function kind of then normally enough afterwards then , and not become comatose mentally  .

&gt;I almost enjoyed it and thought it was cool and very adult

Unfortunately for kids who experience SA &amp; r\*ape they will be stimulated sexually by the actions of the perp. The digusting dickheads think bc the child ( some can ) also actually can orgasm from it  that they like it ( **no they like the stimulation on their body ) not the actions of the perp** doing it to them . They DO NOT understand anything but that they are receiving pain (poss)  and pleasure at the same time . Depending on how violent the perp is with the child. If it was violent they will also develop an abnormal want ( a severe side effect of trauma ) for violence &amp; sex mixed tog. And will try and recreate  the abuse over again as they grow older . Leading them down into the devastating pathway of hypersexuality of  **violence against themselves in the form of self harm ) .** Which can then of course lead them to addiction(s)  or sucide  behaviors ( as of course they loose all self care and want to protect themselves anymore )  .

It is a violation against their will to be stimulated sexually at such a young age . They are NOT meant to be stimulated in such a way , why? Bc for a child to experience this it will also set them most likely also into a uncontrolled then need for on-going sexual stimulation ( which they have bc they are  use to getting it ) it ruins their little minds into wanting sex &amp; stimulation all the time ( bc kids /teens don't have  regulation techniques ) in place and so can't control themselves (impulse control only comes at a older age )   .

As Just like adult women the child can enjoy the stimulation and release of pleasure hormones into the blood stream that are activated in their little bodies as well. It is NOT bc they like the abuse , but it  is an automatic  reaction of the stimulation though of the sex organs  ( as they are meant to be ) they were **designed to be simulated for pleasure, just NOT as a child. The organs just like an adult will produce pleasure at such a young age.** But they don't have the mental capacity to process it under 12 at all . And so for most it will cause mental issues in some way -&gt; causing them severe mental distress &amp; outward presentation then also of abnormal behaviors to cope with what is occurring for them .",2,False

Dealing with those things is going to be brutal. I think your family can sense it but is lost about how to help. If your in a place to deal with this, with them, then you should try. It's okay to recorrect later. 

I don't know you, your family or your situation, but if you feel safe you should tell them and ask for help. 

Sometimes that's therapy, mental health medicine, podcasts, art, music, yoga and accepting your a mess right now. I got into woodworking, running and welding to deal with the anger.

His struggle is not with you, it's with God, with his sin and rebellion against God.

The vast majority of people who say the will kill themselves don't.

Him using his health, or well being to manipulate you into nudes, writing his name on your body is absolutely disgusting and reprehensible.

Stop enabling this behavior.

Block him on absolutely everything. 

If you want you can block him on everything except one platform (temporarily to send a goodbye message) then block him on this platform the second you send the message.

Ensure you have covered absolutely everything.
If you are on discord or a platform where people can make alternate accounts to message you make your account private. So only people you approve can message you.

If you know people who are his friends who approve of his actions or would forward his messages to you remove them and block them too.

Once again make you account private block him on everything.

After you are as certain as you can be that you have covered everything you can send one goodbye message then instantly block. Do not wait even if you see him begining to type, do not wait to see his reply.

He has already demonstrated a depraved mind an almost irredeemable personality.

He will only send threats, gaslighting or attempting to threaten you about your photos or himself.

But if he is blocked these threats won't reach you and are utterly ineffective.

And he is left to deal with himself and God.

As we all do when judgement day comes.

Stop enabling him. You're not his mom, you're not his savior.

vt7lih,,0,Broken_doll4,"&gt;so i solo traveled the first time. didnt speak the language, knew nobody, broke. Also i was mentally abused by him but didnt recognize it until i was out of that situation

You had made a huge mistake meeting up with him and staying with him unfortunately . You didn't know him properly. Who he pretended to be was NOT who he was. He pretended to care about you , but he didn't give a s\*it about you. Unfortunately for you ,u fell for his crap , and put yourself in danger by meeting up with him. He was NOT someone you should have bothered to know . He was a user , and abuser , and only wanted sex from you . You fell for his horrible lies, and he hurt you badly . You were alone , afraid , and way out of your depth with him. He was NOT a nice person, you were trapped with him in a strange place , with him . You were so out of your depth , and you were trapped with him  whilst staying there with him .

&gt;the language, knew nobody, broke. Also i was mentally abused by him but didnt recognize it until i was out of that situation

Going to stay with him was a really dangerous thing to do . You were broke , couldn't speak the language , and were staying with a stranger -&gt;  Who was a horrible person. You put your trust in this stranger and it was a mistake for yourself to do so . And it cost you your mental and physical health bc of it . He was a horrible person to you . He didn't care he was hurting you at all.

&gt;he wanted to do it not even five minutes after he brought me to his home. (also he told me mere days before i traveled that he wants to keep it platonic) i said okay or yes can’t remember exactly. i forced myself as i didn’t feel like i was able to have an actual opinion.

You were always going to be just a f\*ck to him. YOu meant nothing to him and you made the mistake of seeing him on his own territory . You were stuck with him, and YOu were very inexperienced in all ways. Hense why you felt like you had NO option , bc you didn't . He was going to use you all the time. And now you were stuck with this ass wipe in his home. He wanted nothing from you but sex. Everything he said to you was a lie , to get you there in his trap to attack you .

&gt;i forced myself as i didn’t feel like i was able to have an actual opinion. what if i was suddenly on the street having no money or not being able to talk to anyone? i got weirded out a few times

Unfortunately you trusted this man and he lied about everything to you . He would have known you were scared , and alone not knowing what to do . he used this to his advantage to make you do things you didn't want to do . You were stuck with a horrible person who s intent was just to use you . You would have known you were in big trouble with him . So did what he wanted even though YOU did not want to . It was rape by him. He had you trapped with him , scared and alone of him and the situation you were now in . You didn't know what to do , or who to turn to either. You had no one to help you either.

&gt;(he was using his brothers apartment while his brother was on vacation and he came back ten minutes after he threw me out) i was hurting, scared, anxious. and my train got canceled on top. he didn’t reply anymore, he ghosted me for like two weeks before acknowledging my existence again. only because i mentioned my uti.

He didn't care that he was hurting you. You were nothing to him . He was only there to get sex out of you . You would be wise to see a Dr about poss STD's also . This man lied about everything so he might of also had something.  Sorry this man did a real number on you , he was a very nasty person to you . Cruel , nasty , horrible person to you . He didn't care that he hurt you physically  either.

&gt;we both blamed it on it being my „first time“. is this sexual assault or am i just exaggerating like he always said i was?

This man didn't care about you . He hurt you bc he could . He didn't care that it was your first time, it was rape. You were to scared to say NO to him. You were stuck with him in his home , alone and very frightened of him. You were stuck staying with him , alone with no money to leave. Hense why you should never have gone there , but by the time you realized this it was to late. You were stuck , scared and knew he wanted sex from you . You were to scared to say no to him . It was rape then . He was a horrible person you thought you could trust . But he lied to get you there alone with him . And so when you went there it was   a trap for you .

&gt;and he came back ten minutes after he threw me out) i was hurting, scared, anxious. and my train got canceled on top. he didn’t reply anymore, he ghosted me for like two weeks

He didn't care you were hurt and in pain. He didn't care about you at all  . He was never going to keep in touch with you . He got what he wanted to use you for sex. You thought he cared about you , sorry **NOT at all.** He didn't care about you as a person at all. You were nothing to him but to use for sex. Hense why he just threw you out , bc he was a horrible person . Who only got you to come to him for sex -&gt; to use &amp; abuse you. He should go to jail for attacking you . You couldn't handle the situation , you were scared of him . And he forced sex on you ( many times ) when you didn't want it. You were trapped with him and had no where to go to get away from him either.",2,False

The thing is after i went to stay with him i was going to be done with him until i accidentally found out he had been doing the same thing to another girl right before starting to talk to me (she did lie about the physical thing; it triggered me as my childhood best friend got raped when we were teens and i felt horrible for not having prevented it, so i was really trying to do it right this time) and i got our friends involved because i‘m horrible with confrontation by myself. Funnily enough when i did end up first talking to that guy he went -are you accusing me of rape- while i never mentioned anything like that; i didnt see how horrible it was yet. I thought it was because he wanted something for his victim card (he ended up convincing about everyone that i was lying) but now i think he knew what he was doing. I didnt think he would be so horrible to plan something like that, that it was just miscommunication, but you‘re right. He just used me. 
I thought i was over it (and i‘m happily in a relationship now with someone i do feel comfortable enough to say no to, which was the first step to realise how bad it was with that ass) until just recently i found out after i left the community he did it to another girl, but she was smarter than me and did not go see him. 
I‘m repulsed by him, he‘s in his 20s and still only hits on girls that are barely legal…

Also i do fortunately go to a gynecologist regularly and as far as they (i switched to another one) both said i was fine health wise. But that definitely crossed my mind as well

vp54uk,,0,Real_Pea5921,"Hi Friend. To start here is the definition of sexual assault: “Sexual assault and abuse is any type of sexual activity that you do not agree to, including: inappropriate touching. vaginal, anal, or oral penetration. sexual intercourse that you say no to. rape.”

When I say this it’s not to invalidate any of your feelings or invalidate any of your experiences. Just how I am reading the information you have presented this how it’s seems to me. A lot of your experiences are not sexual assault. To me it appears a lot of them are sexual harassment.

First experience I would have to agree with the man, it’s not sexual assault. Second experience that could be classified as harassment, or sexual harassment. Not assault. 3rd time not sexual assault either, the lady asked for your consent and you declined, and she respected that. The fourth time is sexual harassment or harassment in general not SA. 

My intent is not invalidate your experiences at all, but coming from the experience of being raped, I am personally offended to read something claiming assault so many times when it’s not. Its hard to read it because you claim SA a lot, and to have experience rape firsthand it can be read as invalidating other survivors or taking the word/experience for granted. Maybe that’s not your intention, but please read up on it more and really think about it was SA. I can understand that what you have experienced has caused some trauma or PTSD. 

This post again is not to invalidate your feelings or experience, just please educate yourself more in manner. It’s offending to myself and maybe to others who have been raped or have experienced more than what you are claiming is SA.",1,False

You’re not responsible for his actions, you’re not responsible for what he does or thinks. You can’t let this scumbag loose and protected because of your sympathy.

If things happen that shift to you being the problem and for whatever reason your boyfriend sides or doesn’t believe you then please do yourself a favor and let him go.

Rest assure that whatever he decides to do with his life is up to him and I know it sounds harsh but you’ve got to ignore that and listen to yourself. 

I do apologize if I sound harsh, it’s just horrible how much this douche is using and exploiting your weakness to better and keep himself off of trouble.

However, by your own words, you chose to not get up &amp; walk out the 1st time he overstepped. Or the 7th, or the 17th. Maybe the 27th too considering how prolonged this went on. Your reasoning doesn’t wash, &amp; I have many of your same emotional attributes. You were capable of verbally offering numerous “alternative” solutions (including your own BF!) so this was an ongoing negotiation, not some frozen reaction. You have no reason to hate yourself, but you will anyway if you carry this secret. You essentially stood in front of a barreling train &amp; chose not to step off the tracks, despite having both the verbal &amp; physical ability to do so (no indication you were prevented from leaving), while telling yourself not to take the step off the tracks. We are not responsible for the acts others do to us. This guy was 1000% a raping piece of trash. But we are responsible for avoiding, or getting out if we can, of unsafe situations with deteriorating conditions. This one was glaringly obvious after he made move #1 &amp; then continued after being shot down. This sounded so ridiculously prolonged I was simultaneously horrified for you &amp; at you for tolerating the first couple dozen attempts. My sincere apologies if this is perceived as victim-blaming. Its not intended that way. But you would likely benefit from counseling, as your boundaries are non-existent judging by this story.

I promise you deserve better &amp; Im sorry this happened. Dont hold his secret. It will fester &amp; rot you from the inside.

I verywell know it myself that it’s irrational but my emotions are tangible and real.

I got all anxious about the eventuality in which my parents find out about it.

My parents found out and tell me that I was going to do it.

I beg them not to, not being able to explain the deep reason behind my choice (I did not even fully know back then since I only remembered about traumatic experiences last year, at 19).

They did not change their mind.

The day comes and I was nervous since the start of it. I was only hoping not to be naked. I also make it clear to my mom that if the doctor asks me to bare myself I will refuse profusely.

my turn comes and I get asked the general questions. when it was the time to take measurements, weight etc I explicitly answer the doctor that I did not feel like taking anything off other than shoes and jacket.

I succed and feel a bit safer. Keep in mind I am being super polite w them as I always am, even if I was scared and nervous.

I get asked to lay on the bed (that position made me feel so vulnerable but I did). They start to check my pulse and pressure, but they say thigs like “it would be easier if you were naked” (small heart attack). I was feeling sick even only by feeling their hands on my arms.

I don’t know exactly how or when, but they force my shirt up with my bra. I was probably softly crying, but i kept saying ‘’please, no. I don’t want to, pull it back on, please. Please. Please. Please!’’.

Then they unbuttoned my jeans and lowered them so that my pussy was the only thing visible. i felt their fingers pressing around my panties and in an instant they where tugging my underwear down and touching and moving my vagina.

After that i remained silent with my eyes closed. they run a few extra exams on me but I remained still on the bed with nothing to cover my body. I felt invaded, betrayed and uncapable of protecting myself (even if I was not in physical danger). When the doctor finished I was given privacy in a bathroom to put my bra on and there was a small mirror, when I looked into it I could not meet my own gaze. I felt repulsive and dirty.

My protests where true and deep, not to be misunderstood with juvenile whims. the car ride back home I was hostile and angry at my mother ( she was there during my examination). I remember not being able to have a normal conversation at lunch, nor appetite.

After lunch I went to my room and silently cried in despair, still feeling I needed to clean myself. To this day I can’t even hear my relatives speaking about health. I KNOW it’s so incredibly important to be healthy, and I do everything I can to be, but going to the doctor is a nightmare. I was never visited after that day. I am scared to tell anyone when I have the most insignificant headache or periodcramps. The few times I went to the doctor (wrist related problem) I get paranoid until I am out the studio and with all my clothes on.

I am sorry if I spelled something wrong or the structure of the periods are not perfect, I am writing this for the first time and it’s messing me up. I would really appreciate someone’s support as I can’t tell anyone I know. It’s been eating me alive for so long, I am exhausted",2,True
v7z563,Chococigarette@0,1,Professor_dumpkin,"A doctor cannot perform an examination on a patient without their consent. A doctor should also explain why they are doing what they are doing on an exam. They certainly should not have forcibly removed your clothes, There’s not really a reason to be without a bra on in a general physical unless they are doing a breast exam, which it doesn’t sound like happened. They could also briefly check for proper development and any irregular moles but that doesn’t require more than a moment’s look over. I’ve had my vagina briefly glanced at and palpated in a general non gynecological exam. The purpose of touching you there needed to be made clear and it was not, furthermore they did not ask permission it seems.how long did that touch last? If it was very brief it may have been not sexual in nature and for exam purposes however that doesn’t mean it was okay to not inform you and touch you without permission. 
I would say it is definitely assault although if it was sexual in nature or not is unclear to me, so its really a question was it assault or sexual assault? Also, how old are you?

Thank you again and I hope you're doing better.",3,True
v46huz,,0,Unknown_Person93,"I am sorry for the horror you have been through with this guy and I am very proud of you that you were brave enough to report him to the police (I didn't report mine yet and I am not sure whether I will ever have the courage to do so).

I can relate very much to your story as I've had the same problem: I also was assaulted and raped repeatedly by a ""friend"" over a longer period (about two years) and I kept seeing him despite all of this. I cannot tell you exactly what might be the reason why you went back to your abuser, but in my case it was because I had a lot of family problems back then, a broken mental health &amp; self-esteem (due to emotional abuse by other people than him, loneliness etc.) and he was my only closer ""friend"" at that time who, unfortunately, was a very manipulative person as well. And just like you, I didn't realize for a long time that I was an assault victim, but instead, I kept telling myself that it must've been an accident whenever he did it as it would've been too much for my psyche back then to acknowledge that a person I trusted violated me so terribly. It even went so far that I thought maybe it was not so bad and I probably even enjoyed it (of course I did not). Now, 7 years after the first assault and 5 years after the last, I am painfully aware of all the red flags that should've made me more alert back then and it hurts me even more as I failed to protect myself from this disgusting person.

So yea, maybe you recognize something as well in my story which helps you to find an answer to your question? You also mentioned that you consider yourself a people-pleaser. I also used to have (and unfortunately still have) people-pleasing tendencies which got me into abusive situations with several toxic people, so I understand and empathize with you. I think sex predators can spot us people-pleasers very well and know how to manipulate us.

Maybe I cannot really help you to find an answer that gives you peace, but I wish you all the love &amp; support you need to heal from this trauma. And I hope your perpetrator gets arrested and will receive the punishment he deserves.",2,False
v46huz,Unknown_Person93@0,1,_Lea-n-der_,"(I'm so sorry for the very long reply but I thank you for sharing your story as we have similar backgrounds.)

I am so very sorry to hear you went through something very similar. Thank you so much for praising me about my courage - truth is, I would have never been able to report my rapist to the police without the help of my psychologist and my true wonderful friends. I even found the idea absurd when my psychologist suggested I report my rapist during an appointment -that's how far up I was in denial. I can tell you must be a very courageous person too. Thank you for trusting me and sharing your story with me.

And it might be surprising but I was going through the exact same thing! I lived with my parents at the time and we weren't on the best of terms -there was a lot of arguing and fighting (never physical)- and a few months before all of this happened, a girl I thought loved me had broken up with me in a very harsh manner. I wasn't doing the best mentally and I've always had a very low self-esteem. The four of us -my sister knew my rapist and his girlfriend too- used to go out quite often to just hang out so I counted on this fairly new friendship to make up for the bad relationships I had been in before.

I thought the exact same thing, just like you did. ""It might have been an accident, maybe he didn't mean to send me these texts and pictures, maybe he didn't mean to go that far."" I even thought maybe he was drunk when he started sending me these texts and pictures. And when it escalated and got physical, I told myself I deserved it because after all, if I was still talking to him and seeing him, maybe that was because I wanted it to happen to me but couldn't admit it to myself because my rapist had a girlfriend. Turned out I couldn't stop feeling anxious, depressed and even suicidal at times when all of it was happening and I convinced myself the way I felt had nothing to do with my rapist but with what was going on at home. I couldn't -and wouldn't- see the truth.

I do think sex predators choose their victims """"wisely"""" in the way that they know how to manipulate and even coerce us into doing things we absolutely want no part in. They even convince us we like it as much as they do!

Thank you again so, so much for sharing your story with me. I'm relieved to know you're not seeing this person anymore and I'm proud of you for talking about what happened to you because that can be such a hard thing to do. I hope you have found the support, help and love you needed and that you're able to recover and heal. 

And I do hope justice will do its job and get my rapist sentenced. No rapist deserve to go about their life as if nothing ever happened when they have done such a terrible, horrible thing to another person.",2,True
v46huz,_Lea-n-der_@1,2,Unknown_Person93,"Thank you very much for your kind &amp; considerate words. I don't mind the length of the text, but I appreciate you took the time to read my story as well, reacted to it &amp; shared additional information. I thank you for your trust. I'm glad you recognized the truth, stopped blaming or telling yourself you deserved this and managed to see this guy for what he really was: an abuser who took advantage of your kindness &amp; vulnerability.   


Indeed it seems there are a lot of similarities between our stories (unfortunately). Interestingly, just like in your case, I also felt safe with the perpetrator initially as he used to be a housemate &amp; friend of one of my brothers - which is also one of the reasons I am too terrified to report him to the police. Not only do I feel uncomfortable to describe my SA experience to the police, the judges in the court and other strangers, I am also not comfortable with the idea that my family might find out about it as well, as my rapist tried to reach out to my brother to re-establish contact (I think my brother recognized at some point how toxic this person was - without me even mentioning the SA - and cut off ties with him just like me). The relationship with my family members is not very strong and I am afraid they might consider me very stupid that I let the assaults happen several times. When I was a child, my mother would often freak out &amp; punish me if I would come home late or talk to male strangers, as her biggest concern was that I could get raped (I think she was a survivor herself). My brothers made fun of me a lot about this when they were younger. So yea, this is the reason why I am afraid I might be made fun of, or not taken serious or even blamed by my own family if they ever find out about it, and I think it would put me into a very terrible state of mind. I don't want them to know about this. I don't want anyone in my circle of friends, family &amp; acquaintances to know about this as it would probably change their perception of me. I guess I am not as strong yet, unlike you, to open up about this to the important people in my life.  


So what can I say...it is nice to hear that you have supportive friends with whom you could share your trauma and they motivated you to report your rapist. Friends like these are rare and thus very valuable. &lt;3 Also nice that your therapist took your problem serious and supported you in this process as well.   


I wish you all the best. Stay strong!",2,False
v46huz,Unknown_Person93@2,3,_Lea-n-der_,"Thank you very much again for your reply. I appreciate your words of praise and encouragement. They do mean a lot.

Facing the truth about my abuser had had to be one of the most difficult things I had to go through because I feel like we sometimes """"idealize"""" our abusers in order to endure the assaults. For me, it's like creating and living inside of a bubble of denial -in which you try your best to create a safe space- and when that bubble bursts, you have to come face to face with truth -hence why I didn't want to leave my own bubble if that makes sense.

I totally understand not feeling comfortable talking about your SA to the police, judges or other strangers. Going through such horrific events is traumatic enough but having to retell it in details to strangers can make it worse if the people listening are not sympathetic. I was agreeably surprised when I reported my abuser because the police officer was understanding and even supportive of me. I was very, very lucky that day.

I'm glad your brother also cut off all ties with him. And I'm so, so sorry to hear your family wouldn't be supportive of you if you came forward about what happened to you. Just know it wasn't your fault; it never was. No one can or should blame you for something completely out of your control. You're not guilty because you kept talking and seeing him; he was abusive, manipulative and overall toxic and it's incredibly hard to get away from these people. It's very sad to hear about how much victims of SA get stigmatized when we're actually the victims, not the perpetrators. 

You deserve all the help, support, peace and love people can give you. None of this was ever your fault and your reputation should never be tarnished because someone abused you. His reputation, on the other hand, should be the one who gets tarnished because of what he did to you. He's the one who should be ashamed and blamed for his actions, not you.

I'll be forever geateful to be surrounded by an amazing therapist and friends without whom I probably wouldn't even be here to tell my story today. 

Thank you for being such a gentle and genuine person. I can tell you're nice and you care about people. You're stronger than you think. Way, way stronger. I hope you can find people willing to be there for you if you decide to talk about your SA to the people around you one day. It's your decision and no one can force you to talk/not talk about it. You do what feels right to you.

I totally agree to you that it should be our abusers not us who get stigmatized and blamed. But I think people who have never been through anything like this cannot grasp that SA can happen to anyone in any situation. It must be a terrifying realization for some. So they deny this idea and protect their own peace of mind by shifting the blame. Putting the blame on the victim might restore their illusion of control (admitting that sometimes we do not have control over a situation is a scary and too unpleasant thought). At least, this is what I believe. But yea, victim-blaming in order to avoid their own discomfort is very devastating to people like us and only helps the perpetrators. It perpetuates sexual violence. I wish society would understand this.  


Nice to hear that the police officer reacted with understanding and was supportive of you (I've heard this is not always the case, sadly). This gives me hope.

And you are absolutely right! I had to realize not everyone will understand (or even just try to) what we experienced. The girlfriend of my rapist told me that something like that would have never happened to her because she would have fought back. Her relatives told her it was impossible to get sexually assaulted mutliple times by the same person. She cut all contact with me and stayed with my rapist.

It's a sad reality but like you, I do think some people have a hard time understanding the impact SA has on victims, so blaming the victims -and sometimes even telling themselves that the victims consented to the act(s)- is probably easier to accept than realizing what rapists are capable of.

I was very, very lucky that day. And you do what makes you feel the most comfortable. It's reassuring being able to share our experinces with others we know won't judge us. I think it's important to have a safe space.

I do not believe there is a place in the entire world where the legal age of consent is equal to or less than 6.

This is a process; it takes time and patience with yourself. You're opening up at the pace that seems best to you - don't feel like you need to rush into anything or open up any more than you're able to at any given moment.

u9bqbe,,0,popcorn121212,"SA can be really complicated especially when you add in drugs/alcohol and or it's someone you have a relationship with (friendship or sexual relationship). Although you did a very good job of explain the incident and the situation, it's hard to say definitely who is in the wrong and it's probably a combination. Someone can be intoxicated to the point of not being able to consent while still being able to commit a sexual act. Then you getting into very complicated situation where there is no clear victim and perpetrator yet both parties still feel violated. 

As far as your situation, I would cut yourself some slack. You are young and there is a two year age gap between you and your friend. That can sometimes create a power dynamic depending on the situation/relationship. Sometimes good people put them themselves in situation where they do things they wouldn't normally do. It's okay that you feel guilty and violated at the same time and it makes sense that you do since this situation is complicated. For me journaling really helps or even talking to a therapist might help you better understand your feelings.

u95sge,Technical-Celery-254@0,1,noseykeyser,"Hi /u/conyv I have read your original post and I wanted to strongly reiterate what /u/technical-celery-254 has already said.  Hopefully with two separate people (strangers in reality as I don’t know /u/technical-Celery-255) agreeing the same exact thing it gives you more comfort that what you have said and experienced was not even remotely OK in any way.

The thing is, I know that you already know that (and can confidently say that the user above that I am replying to as well as any other users of this sub would agree the same).  You asking peoples opinions here on the specifics of your original posts title “is what I am feeling wrong &amp; did you experience sexual assault” you know full well that the answer to both of those questions is; NO! What you are feeling is not wrong and YES! You did experience sexual assault.

As /u/Technical-Celery-254 said in their initial first few sentences, your feelings are totally valid, not wrong and you did experience several different instances of sexual assault.  

Please remember OP that the words Sexual Assault are not a blanket term that covers a timeframe or period of Sexual assault.  To explain what I mean OP let’s say for example this person who abused you touched your boobs initially, you then moved his hand away (and maybe said no or maybe you didn’t even say a word because you were frozen) and then he touched your boobs again let’s say 20/30 seconds later.  Again you moved his hand away (and again maybe you verbally said no or maybe you were to frozen to say anything) then 20/30 seconds later, he again touches your boobs.  Maybe this time you don’t move his hand away, maybe again this time you don’t say anything verbally?

The reality is in this particular example is that he has sexually assaulted you on 3 separate occasions here.  It doesn’t matter that all 3 times happened in the space of no more than 1.5/2 minutes.  It doesn’t matter that you didn’t verbally say no.  It doesn’t matter if you never once moved his hand.  The key thing in this example is you never gave consent and informed consent at that.

A lot of victims tend to use the terms Sexual Assault or similar variations as a blanket term to cover and describe a ‘whole ordeal’ and everything that happened within, when the reality is every sexual element is an individual assault in its own right.

When you mentioned in your OP that after several different occasions of him doing this, that you challenged him as to why he was doing what he had been doing- his response to you doesn’t surprise me in the slightest.  Him saying to you that he was doing it because he knew that it made you feel totally uncomfortable and he likes making you feel uncomfortable are the words of a sexual predator.  The vast majority of sexual predators tend to sexually assault and abuse their victims, not because they get off sexually ‘by being intimate’ but they get off sexually by exerting control or putting a victim in fear.  His response to you asking him why he was doing it and him saying about making you uncomfortable is what you Americans would say is a ‘101 nailed on response’

As /u/technical-Celery-254 says, you need to end all contact with him, don’t go to any further future social gatherings when you know he will be there beforehand, as for those future social gatherings where you or others don’t expect him to be there, but when you do get there and he is there, leave them also.

I would also go as far to say that you shouldn’t just fuck him off but give some serious thought as to fucking off the whole of that friend group too.  The basis for me saying that is where you mentioned that you spoke to friends within that group and they invalidated your various sexual assaults by him, they watered them down as not being serious or ‘not as bad as serious ones so therefore in essence acceptable’ in their eyes.  The demonstrates that you cannot rely on members of this friend group for support and ultimately they are ‘enablers’ enabling him to SA people.  In my honest opinion and for many others, they are as bad as him and what he has continually done to you if not worse.

Fuck the lot of them off and with the nicest possible meaning (not wanting to sound like I am devaluing what happened) you’ve currently had a very lucky escape.  (I hope you understand the context that was meant)",5,False

tgv8x5,,0,gladiolasnheadaches,"I'm so sorry that the people who were supposed to help you and the people you trusted enough to open up to turned around and victim-blamed and did not believe you or the severity. 

I am so sorry they told you that you would've known that you both would be close. That is just so, so wrong. That's like telling a victim of a robbery that it was their fault because they were carrying their wallet in front of who they should have known was a robber. You were literally just living your life when *he* chose to do this. You are so right when you say what they said was degrading. 

And I am so sorry that they chalked this guy off to ""not knowing"" and being ""apologetic."" First of all, he literally said ""I'm putting you in a compromising position,"" so obviously he knew (and he still knew even if he hadn't said that). But whether or not he had said anything at all, I am astounded (though not surprised) that the police told you that this guy - who literally committed the action - did ""not know"" yet you - a victim - were supposed to know what you were getting into?!?! WTF?! And then to top it off, they say he's ""apologetic"" as if that absolves him from everything. I am so, so sorry.

It sounds like you recognize that this was not your fault, which is a recognition that is already difficult to make with SA but is even more difficult when there are people around you telling you that you had responsibility for this. I hope you are seeing the strength and courage you have in recognizing and accepting the truth that it is not your fault in spite of what others tell you.

I have experienced something similar in being victim-blamed, seeing the red flags before the assault, and the guy who assaulted me being allowed to continue his education at the same school as me. Though it is still painful to remember and acknowledge, it does get better. There is hope that you will feel okay and the burden of this experience will not weigh so heavily on you. 

Also from personal experiences, I want to say - be careful who you share details with. I learned the hard way that ""friends"" (both guy and girl friends) would not *say* they believed me until I shared details for the following reason: they actually did know that it happened, but they wanted details to either gossip or to know for their own sick, depraved curiosity. I'm not saying that this friend of yours had the same intentions as mine did, but you might run into someone later who does, so be careful.

If someone - especially a friend - does not believe you, the burden of proof does not rest on you for them to become convinced it happened. If he really knew you as a friend, the burden of proof lies on him to recognize that you are not someone who is or has been a ""Karen"" or as someone who overreacts. But I think you know that.

My response is also really long haha I hope something from this helps you. Take care, and I wish the best for you.",2,False
tgv8x5,gladiolasnheadaches@0,1,throwawayforlemoi,"Thank you so much. Reading your words means a lot. Honestly, I do feel guilty, even though I know it isn't my fault. 
I feel guilty for not ending the friendship sooner and I feel guilty for not saying anything while I was in the situation, but I couldn't. I tried to explain it away. 
But I know that it's on him, that it was his decision, and even if he exhibited red flags, I couldn't have known he'd go that far. 

Their reasoning was complete bullshit. I felt awful after reading the letter. 
They pretty much said that he left the situation at some point, like??? Of course he did. He was finished, whatever that meant for him. He was bound to get up at some point. 
It's an awful feeling to know that the people who are supposed to bring justice not only fail at it but also blame the victim. 

I only shared it with the police, my close family, my best friend and the friend in question. 
That friend in question turned out to also be kind of.. complicated, I'd say. He often disregards other people's opinions and facts in order to be right or better, if that makes sense. 
I thought I could share it with him, especially since he knew how the guy was (getting way too close, not respecting boundaries etc). But then getting laughed at and dismissed is awful. 
I also just remembered he still makes jokes about how the guy just wanted some [insert my nationality] pussy. So yeah, I pretty much regret sharing it with him. 
Not sure what his intentions were/are exactly, but I'm guessing not the greatest ones. 

You're right, though. The burden shouldn't be on me. But when you open up and the other person doesn't believe you or tells you you're overreacting, you feel like you have to justify yourself.

There are still rumors going around regarding why he left the school so suddenly. It weighs on me that the others in my grade might find out and think I'm an attention seeker or liar, especially since some of them aren't that keen on me anyway. 
It's all just a lot. 

To be honest though, it really sucks you went through something similar. You didn't deserve it either. No one does. 
I hope that, even if it doesn't just disappear, the wound healed and all that's left is just a scar.
 
If I may ask, how did you handle the aftermath? Did you contact the police or maybe a counseling center? And how long did it take for you to feel like it didn't weigh on you as much anymore?
You don't have to answer if you aren't comfortable with it, there's no pressure. 

I'm wishing you all the best, though.",3,True
tgv8x5,throwawayforlemoi@1,2,gladiolasnheadaches,"I've written so much and have tried and tried to cut it down but idk how to haha so I have **bolded** what I think are the most important points in case you want to skim it instead.

**You're right** \- you couldn't have known. I'm sorry you are dealing with guilt. Unfortunately, guilt often comes with the territory of SA. **You didn't do anything wrong** \- being friends, not saying anything in the moment, trying to explain it away - none of that is wrong. But recognizing that does not always help alleviate the guilt. That's something I have also had to work through.

Rumors are a lot to deal with, but the good thing about them is that their life cycle is usually pretty short. In the meantime though, I'm sorry you are having to learn to deal with this from a difficult situation. It makes sense that you worry they might gossip about you. It sounds like it hasn't come to that so far. Hopefully, it won't ever, and talk about him will die out soon.

Thanks, it does suck that it happened to me, and I agree - I wish it never happens to anyone. I guess you could say some of a scar has formed. **I don't have an open wound anymore, but I definitely have a scab** that opens up (either by me picking at it or others causing it to open up again). But I am healing and am doing way better than before.

To answer your questions:

I'm about **1.5 years into healing**. I was assaulted in an abusive relationship, unfortunately, so there has been a lot of things that I also had to heal from that weren't SA.

I **didn't go to the police, but I did talk to the Title IX office** at my university and got a No Contact Order. So he can't talk to me, which has been nice haha.

I **started talk therapy, but it wasn't super helpful bc** a lot of the trauma therapists (where I am, anyway) practice **CBT**, which didn't work for me, primarily because it made me feel like my experiences were ""all in my head."" They are in my head to an extent, but it really invalidated my emotions and my physical responses to trauma (ex. loss of appetite, difficulty falling asleep, trouble paying attention, etc). I found **more success in music therapy**.

The **best part of talk therapy was getting diagnosed** with depression (and other stuff), bc it finally **gave me a label for what I was feeling, which validated** a lot of my emotions, helped me figure out a course of action, and allowed me to talk with professors if I was struggling in their class.

I won't lie - **things got a heck of a lot worse before they got better**. I couldn't get out of bed for a few months and life felt pretty hopeless. So healing was really slow, and almost imperceivable in the moment, though it is really obvious to me now (I am way better than where I was 1.5 years ago). I say that in case you feel like things will never get better.

Though healing was slow, this is how I handled the aftermath:

\- when things/feelings got too overwhelming: I learned to **take things as bite size pieces**. For a few months, I lived minute by minute until I could handle hour by hour then day to day. The same goes for my classes. I had to become a part-time student for a few semesters bc that's all I could handle.

\- processing: I also started **processing in ways that felt good** to me like drawing, writing, music (both listening and playing), and recently, exercising. For example, I'd draw silly little comics about what happened or what I felt/thought that day or what I wished I could say to him but couldn't. I **also educated myself** on SA, effects of SA, trauma + trauma responses when I had the energy. I have found that knowledge is empowering to me, so learning about what I was going through really helped me show myself grace, answered some of the confusion I had, and also validated my feelings.

\- grieving: I'm not sure if you are experiencing/will experience this, but SA changed my whole viewpoint of the world. I had to accept that I will never be the person I was before the SA bc of those changes, which was really saddening to me. I had to **grieve (sometimes I still do) the loss of who I was**.

\- support: 2 big things really helped my healing - **hope and truth**. I had someone really close to me continually reassure me that I will be okay, and it wasn't a flippant reassurance. It was like ""bro, you made it through the week. That's big, and shows what you can do"" or ""that's okay if you don't think you will be okay. I'll believe it for the both of us."" **Truth is what helped me with problems like guilt or shame**. I used to feel really guilty that I didn't recognize what he was doing to me and stayed in the relationship. Someone else close to me would remind me of the truth - I trusted him, which is not the wrong thing to do. In fact, that's the normal human thing to do, especially in a relationship. He is the person who should feel guilty because he did the wrong thing of taking advantage of my trust.

\- religion/spirituality: I'm not here to spiritualize you, but to answer your question honestly, I turned to my faith more than ever before and **found relief there, too**.

**Everyone heals differently, so what worked for me might not work for you and vice versa. Also, the timeline for healing is unique for everyone.** Hopefully something from this helps you on your journey of healing. I hope I answered what you were asking! Sorry it's so long!!!",2,False

One thing to consider is the law where you live because there's a lot of types of SA and they can be recognized under different names. It's important to remember that SA is an umbrella teem and can describe a number of categories of SA. For example, I live in California and here are a couple of types recognized by law here:

-Rape: generally defined as non-consentual penile-vaginal sex.

-Sodomy: non-consentual penile-anal sex

-Foreign object penetration: non-consentual vaginal penetration by finger or other object

-Forced oral copulation: non-consentual oral sex (can be either given or received)

-Sexual battery: unwanted touching of buttocks, genitals, and/or breast

-Lewd and lascivious act on a minor: sex act (can involve penetration, but not necessarily) performed on a minor

-Annoy/molest of a minor: milder version of above, includes catcalling, verbal sexual harassment, etc

There are others, but you get the idea.",1,False

In that situation you're always going to have some fear, because... what if this isn't innocent? But at the same time... he's left some ambiguity there.

sibo6b,,0,Broken_doll4,"`After talking to one of our other friends recently I’ve been learning that he was actually extremely transphobic.`

You are assuming alot of stuff here . Just bc he might be with other people ( transphobic) he mighten be with you and genuinely might of just been  helping you ( or he mighten even be at all ) . It is very hard to know definitely ( unless you hear it yourself or see it yourself ) don't just blindly trust others say  . And just bc your other friends say he is -&gt;( ask yourself  are they for real ?).  Otherwise this is assuming what you are NOT sure of for REAL.

You only felt weird after ( your so called friends said this ) it mighten even be true? Who knows ?? Or yes it might have been a weird thing for him to do . Maybe best not to ask him to help again with you . To be on the safe side. But remember be carful always trusting what others say &amp; do sometimes people ( yes do pretend ) what they are not eg- a friend. ( maybe they don't like him &amp; this was a way to get rid of him from their life).

`Anyways, one of my best friends as the time knew I kept getting hurt pulling it off to soon and so he offered to help me. I said yes because we were close or so I thought.`

He may actually was just helping you bc saw you were having issues. Or yes it might have a been more . But don't assume to know the answers though . You would have to ask  him outright , or over hear him actually saying something about stuff like that . Remember hear say is dangerous ( it may not be correct or it may actually be a pack of lies). Sorry people can and do lie around others , just to cause issues also . So do be carful once an accusation is out (it cannot be taken back ) . And there is a risk that someone might be throwing crap on another person when not warranted.

`Me and this friend haven’t talked in months now, and something just hasn’t been sitting right with me.`

Ask your friends did they say something to him ? They might have planned to get rid of him from your life. Or yes he might have been upset by what occurred btw you both . Hard again to know. The only way would be to ask around and ask him what might have occurred . Keep a open mind until maybe some answers come up for you about it all.

`Was he using me? For more context for anyone who doesn’t really understand the process of taking this off, there is a lot of touching, holding, etc`

There are many things that might have gone through his mind also ( maybe he did get abit aroused by it being near you ) . Which made him feel like a perv then . And felt horrible that he did . Hense why he didn't / hasn't contacted you bc of it .  He yes might have found himself liking you instead of ( being upset / not liking it ) by seeing your breasts ( and was embarrassed by it ) not sure of how to cope with liking it . As most people yes wouldn't wouldn't want ot hang out with someone they didn't like usually. So he did hang with you often ( you were close ) before all this happenend . Then seeing your semi-naked made him feel weird . Bc he did get yes abit aroused by it maybe even ?",1,False

And the friend who was talking to me hasn’t talked to this other friend in a long while now and doesn’t even know about this stuff going on.

Edit: to be fair, I’m pretty disconnected from my chest, because to me it feels it doesn’t belong there. But it’s also something that makes me really insecure and not comfortable in my own skin.

but yeah, you say he became emotionally abusive later in the relationship so that only supports my suspicions that he took your ‘no to sex before marriage or anything else’ and twisted it into ‘no sex before marriage but fine with other stuff’. you said what you said, he played a risk by seeing if he would get away with twisting your words and over stepping your boundaries and he’s probably done it again since unfortunately",1,False

You can label this however you need to as well, even though I was sexually assaulted by definition I don't identify as a sexual assault survivor. It's all in how you feel.

s2qz73,,0,Due-Situation4183,"Okay. So, here's the thing. You two making out and him touching your breasts was all fine if that's what you two had agreed to. Then, he lifted your shirt and arguably even though you were uncomfortable that would be a natural progression since if he could feel them without a bra or a shirt in the way then seeing them without a bra or shirt would be okay in most situations. Escalations like that are normal in sexual relationships and it's important that you practice setting and enforcing boundaries in sexual relationships for exactly that reason so your relationships in the future can be as healthy as possible. But, then you set a clear boundary. ""Stop touching my nipples."" You didn't ask him to stop pushing them so hard or doing circles. You told him point blank to stop touching them entirely and he ignored that boundary fully informed. That immediately made it sexual assault. Everything past that point was sexual assault. You didn't need to say no to anything else. The progression was halted and a boundary set. Going from breasts to genitals was inherently off the table unless otherwise specified and even if it wasn't you moved away making it clear that your consent was not present. You may believe he had no ill intent if you want and maybe that would help you to heal from this trauma easier, but that doesn't change the fact that he hurt you willfully.

Your story reminds me of mine. 
My now ex husband had been really difficult, moody, gaslighting and other mental abusive things for a very long time.
In the end the trauma bonding was so severe I couldn't think straight.
He had threatened to leave me and that devastated me. So he had a ""solution"". He said this: ""I am leaving you unless you have sex with me every day."" Our 19 year old son was downstairs waiting for us. So I said 'right now?' He said yes. I managed to delay it until the evening. Then he was waiting for me in bed and told it was now or he was leaving and it would be my own fault. So I gave in. Two days in a row.
I have a habit of keeping a journal so that event was in there step by step.
Fast forward 2 months and I was suicidal. The cops came too do a wellness check because the ex thought he would get me with that. Sure enough the cops found my journal while talking to me and asked if they could have a look. Sure, no problem. So they found the story. They asked me if I wanted to charge him.

not just sexual assalt

Have you ever heard the tea analogy?

Also it doesn't matter if we dont say no

It's if we never explicitly said AN ENTHUSIASTIC YES!!! IT IS A FUCK NO. 

A saying that helps me with boundaries is ""if it's not a FUCK YES it's a fuuuuuck nooooooooo""

Also it's always a sexual assault with any drugs/alcohol! Because we have a changed mental state and cannot offer a ""fuck yes"" for a sober version of us.

rm58vi,,0,bbdoublechin,"&gt;Later when confronted they said that they only heard me say I wasn't sure and one no.

That is two clear instances of you setting boundaries. It sounds like your partner is holding onto some pretty toxic ideas around consent. This doesn't mean your partner is a bad person- society conditions people to think a ""no"" or ""I'm not sure"" means ""convince me."" It takes a lot of conscious work to undo that conditioning and replace it with healthy communication and the respect of boundaries.

From your perspective as a SA survivor, I imagine it seems like you have been incredibly clear, which makes the violation feel so much worse. Those feelings are completely valid. However, what seems clear and obvious to you as a survivor might seem completely alien and confusing to your partner, because they don't have the same frame of reference and have a hard time empathizing or understanding.

There are some really great beginner resources out there about how to communicate with someone who has experienced SA, as well as the basics of how consent works and how to set and respect boundaries. I will link some of my favourites below.

When you are in a long term relationship with someone (even if that relationship is not romantic or sexual), you make a commitment to do the hard work necessary to make sure the other person feels safe, comfortable, and happy with you. Your partner has made this commitment to you, and while it will not be an easy process for either of you, you both owe it to yourselves and your future relationships (again, including friendships) to work on these skills and build something stronger together.

If couples counseling is an option, I highly recommend it. If not, therapy for yourself might help you to identify the root of what you're feeling, as well as skills and resources to help talk about it in ways that are constructive. There are also plenty of good free resources on moving on from assault if cost is a barrier.

When you set boundaries and/or say no, that's it. Saying no doesn't mean he should keep asking, harassing, badgering, pleading, begging, or trying to guilt you until you say yes. Coercion is not consent.

I hope you will check out this [article](https://www.scarleteen.com/article/disability_quickies/quickies_sexual_consent_basics), and use it to empower yourself in standing up for your right to control what happens to your body. You have a right to say no. I hope in the future you cut anyone who can't respect not the first time, out of your life. If they can't respect your boundaries, then leave, that's it. No second chances, just leave. Anyone who disrespects you once, will try to do it again. And don't let them ever try to convince you that you are overreacting, it was a mistake, or they were drunk. Stand up for your right to control what happens to your body.

It's not your fault. It's not your fault because you had your boyfriend over. It's not your fault because he was in your room. It's not your fault because you might have done it had he had a condom. It's not your fault because he wouldn't respect your no and harassed you until you gave in. It's his. You said no, but he just cared about getting what he wanted, not what you wanted.

You deserve someone respects your boundaries and cares enough to make sure you want to and are enjoying all aspects of your relationship. You deserve so much more then what happened to you. And I hope you find everything you want in the future.

I'm sorry that this has, and is continuing to really affect you. If you aren't already in therapy, I hope you will give it some serious consideration. I feel like it could really help you.

r1m6tu,,0,Zenhon23,"I'm sorry this happened, and agree with the other commenters. I would just like to add please never make excuses for other people. You aren't responsible for their actions, they are. When you set a boundary, please stick to it, and if they can't respect it the first time, please leave. He knew exactly what he was doing when he kept ""forgetting"" the condom. Being drunk doesn't excuse it even if was the reason he kept ""forgetting.""

You are absolutely right that you cannot consent while asleep, and what he did is SA in my opinion. I'm sorry you felt pressured into giving him a hj to just get it over with, and I wish you had left as soon it was clear he didn't gaf about what you wanted (repeatedly trying to not use a condom.) I'm sorry you didn't feel safe to leave, but I would like to say that women are something like 3 times as likely to be raped by someone they know then by someone they don't. Leaving a known unsafe situation may be better then staying because you are afraid of the unknown situation. 

Too many people think that no means try harder, and think it's ok to just harass, badger, complain, plead, or just straight up ignore what their partner says until they get what they want. Once a person shows they can't be bothered to respect your wishes, that's it. Please leave, and never be around them again, especially alone. Don't listen to them trying down play it, say they were drunk, or that it was a mistake. If they did it once, (or many, many times in your case) they'll do it again, and potentially worse because they think they can get away with it after the first time.

It's a known thing that freshman girls get taken advantaged of because they tend to be inexperienced, isolated, and don't have a support structure around them to turn to. Older people know that these young women can be pressured, begged, or made to feel obligated to do things they don't want to do, and then won't seek out help afterwards because they either don't know to, don't know how, or don't have anyone to reach out to, often leading to continued abuse.

I'm sorry this happened to you but I hope you can use it as a lesson going forward on how important it is for you to stand up for your consent. It sounds like it could have been so much worse, and I'm glad it wasn't. Please be safe and I hope you find the strength to stand up for what you want and deserve in the future.",1,False

In the first case you said no multiple times and he should've abided by the first no anyway. But he kept trying to coerce you and even forced his finger up there. Coercing and penetration without consent are both sexual assault. 

In the second case you were so drunk you couldn't give consent. He should've respected your situation and not tried anything but he kept going and took advantage of you instead. On top of not stopping when you told him to. 

He's done wrong in both cases. If you ever need to talk to someone feel free to DM me. Also, if you prefer to talk to a professional you can ask your GP/dr to refer you to a therapist or contact a sexual assault center near you (google ""sexual assault help &lt;area&gt;"").

And your experience of that night is not invalidated by your hanging out with him afterwards, that is actually pretty common. A lot of us do this because we’re trying to normalize what just happened, make it not what it was. Everything I say here I say as a survivor myself, so please know there is no judgement, only understanding. 

It is clear to me, from his refusal to take no for an answer to his saying “you came here, what did you expect” that that dude is an absolute predator. You know what SHOULD happen in sexual encounters? Enthusiastic consent. We do not have a right to each other’s bodies. It is not the responsibility of women to ward off the unwanted sexual advances of men. It is the responsibility of each party to ensure that the other is enthusiastically consenting and totally on board before we go about inserting things into their body. Also, choking during sex should absolutely be discussed and agreed to beforehand. It is NOT something any person should feel comfortable just *doing* without prior consent.

This guy did not care if you enjoyed the experience. He only cared about himself. So many men do not have sex with women, they masturbate using use women’s bodies. It’s not a shared experience between two humans, it’s a physical sensation for them. And this is A Problem. This is date rape culture. 

Can you imagine for a second being him? Pushing someone into something they’re clearly not into? Can you imagine how little you would have to care about them to do such a thing? How selfish you would have to be?

You are not overreacting. What you experienced was sexual assault. Those who say otherwise  are amongst the predators. And you are not at fault for what he did.

q87uri,,0,[deleted]," This was 100% sexual assault.

If there was penetration of any kind(penis, fingers, toys etc.) It also classifies as rape.

What you experienced was sexual assault by coercion.

Sexual coercion is unwanted sexual activity that happens after being _pressured_ in nonphysical ways that include:

1. _Being worn down by someone who repeatedly asks for sex._

2. Being lied to or being promised things that weren’t true to trick you into having sex.

3. Having someone threaten to end a relationship, spread rumors about you or _display that you will be treated badly_ if you don’t have sex with them.   

4. Having an authority figure use their influence or authority to pressure you into having sex.

In a healthy relationship, you never have to have sexual contact when you don’t want to.

Sexual contact without your consent is assault.  

If someone fails to get consent the first time and has to continue pressuring the person to finally get consent?  That is not enthusiastic consent, it's not real consent and that person does not care whether the other party wanted the sexual contact.

When a person pressures you for consent they are not actually asking for consent, they are making sure you are going to take the responsibility for what _they're_ about to do to you.

You didn't want what happened, you made it clear and in a way you even asked him to drop it by explaining your sexuality and he continued to whine, complain, guilt trip and pressure you into doing what he wanted.

When a person actually cares about your pleasure they will absolutely care about your consent.  

I suggest not interacting with this person again in any way if possible and pressing charges if you're comfortable with that.

I'm not going to lie to you: reporting sexual assaults especially like these are very hard on the victim and can even backfire and you may end up getting sued if the attacker is rich or powerful enough/has rich or powerful friends.

The main reason most victims decide to report is because assailants _almost always try again_, if not with you than with someone else.

_  
Some examples of sexual coercion:  
 
**Wearing you down by asking for sex again and again or making you feel bad, _guilty, or obligated._**   
•“If you really loved me, you’d do it.”
•“Come on; it’s my birthday.”
•_“You don’t know what you do to me.”_

**Making you feel like it’s too late to say no.**   
•_“But you’ve already gotten me all worked up.”_
•“You can’t just make someone stop in the middle.”

**Telling you that not having sex will hurt your relationship.**   
•“Everything’s perfect. Why do you have to ruin it?”

q87uri,[deleted]@0,1,Additional-Nobody644,"There was penetration involved, I never thought to see it that way.

Thank you for this. I do not think I will press charges, because not even violent rapes are taken seriously in my country, so the chances of winning are slim to none, but I already go to therapy and will try to open up about it with my therapist.

I guess admiting it to myself is scary, because then I have to deal with it. Again, thank you so much for taking the time to write this. I hope you have a wonderful day/night.

pyvoj8,,0,[deleted],"I would've said something but the other comment captured what I wanted to say perfectly.

I reported it in August and nothing much came out of it because there wasn't much that could be done because allegedly too much time had passed.

Even if some people don't believe you, everyone on this subreddit believes you. Do what you think is best for yourself, we all believe in you.

pumgvz,,0,[deleted],"Hello, u/Relationshiprepair. I'm sorry to hear that you were treated this way. It sounds like you put a lot of blame on yourself for what happened, but you didn't do anything wrong. You didn't want to have sex. You may not have said no, but you didn't say yes. 

Think of your body like your home. Would somebody have the right to just walk into your home, just because you didn't say no? Of course not. They'd need a clearly expressed yes. You shouldn't feel pressured or forced to let somebody into your home. It should only happen on your terms. Now, the other person has the right to decline too. But sex should only occur if both partners clearly desire and express the desire to do so.

He asked, and continued asking. You felt ignored, because he did ignore you. You ended up having sex under pressure. I'm glad that he stopped once he realized you weren't into it.  But then he lifted you back onto him. He made that decision for you. 

As for your question, is this sexual assault, people may tell you different things. But the most important thing is what you feel. Did you feel satisfied with what happened? Did you want to do it (not just because you wanted to please him; but truly desire for yourself)? Or do you feel violated and used? Answering that question will answer what it was.

ppz2mj,,0,No-dodo-in-sight,"Saying nothing can still mean no. There are many situations where someone is touching you but neither they nor you say anything. Just because you’re silent doesn’t mean yes. Often times, people are so overwhelmed or frightened or shocked by unwanted touch that they freeze. Freezing up can make someone incapable of speaking at all, but that doesn’t make continuing to touch a person OK.

Sometimes, even saying “yes” after someone has pushed you to give in and coerced you into saying yes can still mean no, especially if it was not want you wanted but felt you had to agree to. The very basis of consent is when two people ask “would you be open to exploring this?” or “is this something you’d like to do?” and the other clearly, certainly, and without hesitation says yes. 

Either way, if the contact was unwanted and you felt violated, it is still sexual assault. How you feel after it is valid and there’s nothing you did wrong.

I laid there until it was over and I also had the out of body experience. I will say this: I have had other sexual experiences where I could sense the other person wasn’t really “into” what we were doing and vice versa. In those experiences, we stopped. Because sexual situations are meant to be good for both parties. If someone is unresponsive, unenthusiastic, or out of it, it probably shouldn’t continue—especially without blatant consent. I struggled with calling what I went through as assault because it wasn’t what I had read/seen/heard about.

That being said, I would not call this sexually assault.
I think there is a really blurry line between sexual assault and not giving consent. To me if the other person *reasonably* thinks they're doing something that is consentual but you don't feel like you've given consent it's not necessarily sexual assault. He is not necessarily a predator. But that doesn't mean something happened that it shouldn't have. It also doesn't mean that there was a better way for you to react.

otu2ks,,0,linebreaker-bot,"&gt;So this is my first post to Reddit I've ever made. I made an account a couple months ago thinking I could vent and get stuff off my chest. I thought I was ready to just let it all out. But I guess I wasn't quit there yet. I knew I had suffered sexual abuse to a degree but over the last month I have remembered things I hadn't before. I have suppressed a lot from my past because most of it was traumatic. Recently I have remembered things the boy I dated from the age of 14-19 years old. It was a super toxic relationship but me being an easily manipulated person and having abandonment issues I stayed WAY too long with this guy.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;I grew up Mormon (definitely no longer a member now) and they don't let there kids date until they are 16. So when me and this guy's relationship began we kept it quiet and strictly at school only. When I turned 16 my boyfriend at the time decided we were telling our parents. I was allowed supervised visits with my boyfriend as long as his parents were there. One day while we were at his grandparents house his mom was helping out his grandmother. It was hot inside and his grandma didn't have ac so his mom sent us outside to the back yard as there was nothing for us to help with inside. While sitting outside my boyfriend was telling me stories about his childhood and the pool his grandparents had in there back yard and the shed and his climbing tree.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;He told me he wanted me to see the places he played as a kid in the back of his grandparents yard so we were walking around. At one point we ended up behind the pool. We were completely hidden from the house point of view. At this point he flat out told me he wanted to have sex. The thought of having sex terrified me. I don't know if it was because I grew up Mormon and to even jerk off was a sin or if it was because I had been sexually abused by my older brothers and cousin growing up. Either way I did not want sex yet.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;I wanted to wait until I was 18 and felt safe and comfortable. I told him I was scared too. He told me I wouldn't be scared after the first time was over. He said it would get easier. We were both virgins at this point. He told me to lay down in the grass so I did. He said he wouldn't do anything I wasn't ready for yet. He took it slow at first and just kissed me. I was okay with this because we had done this before. Then he started taking my pants off and I began telling him I didn't want to take off cloths. He ignored me and continued taking off my pants. I started telling him no and tried pulling my pants back up.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;He just started shushing me and telling me I was gonna get us caught. He got my pants off and I froze. He then took my virginity. I still felt like I couldn't move for a couple minutes while he went and rinsed his hands off in the tiney fish water fountain. He came back over to me and I was bloody. He told me he didn't have anything to help with the bleeding and to just pull my panties and pants up. I can't remember what we did after that. Some of it is still fuzzy. But a couple hours later we were back at his house. He convinced his parents to let us go down to the basement to play an arcade game with the basketballs and hoops they had down there.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;There he had me take off my underwear and he stuck them in his pocket to keep them to show his friends. Then he undid his belt and told me to lay on the dirty cold cement floor and I told him I was sore and didn't want to and that I was still scared. He started pulling my pants down again and instructed me to lay on the floor. I pleaded with him not to make me do it. He didn't respond and he didn't seem fazed by my words. He did it anyways and I froze again. But I'm confused. I don't understand why even though I didn't want it I went along with it anyways.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;The first time doesn't make me question as much because I froze. I felt paralyzed. The second time though I laid down when he told me too. I never fought back even though I wanted too. And then I continued dating him for 3 more years as the things he would do to me got worse and more violent. I'm not trying to blame myself. I'm just now remembering what happened. I'm trying to process how I feel and try and figure out what I feel. Confusion as to why someone would let something like this happen and not fight back is for sure one of my feelings. I hate the word and don't even like saying it.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;It just makes me uncomfortable. I know it was a form of sexual abuse. But was this rape? He was 2 years younger than me and we had been dating for 2 years. I told my friends about what I remembered and they didn't seem fazed. It didn't help that one of my best friends is his cousin. Idk I'm just confused I guess.

otu2ks,,0,ComprehensiveWaffle,"Hey bud, this was definitely assault.

Follow-up to your freezing and going with what he wanted stuff is that when in danger, our brains have more than just the fight or flight mode - it's fight, flight, freeze, and fawn. Everyone knows fight or flight, but not necessarily freeze or fawn.

The freeze response happens when there is so much danger that the prefrontal cortex of our brains essentially reboots, and it takes time to come back online. In the meantime we're frozen and can't really do anything about it. In no way is it your fault.

The fawn response is when our brains see the danger again and the primal, survival parts of the brain thinks that the best way out is to go along with whatever our attacker wants, no matter how much it sucks - ergo, you going along with it the second time that day. Again, it's not your fault.

There's more reasons for staying in an abusive relationship, but that's not really my area of expertise. I'd like to reiterate that none of it is your fault At All, and I hope you have an affordable therapy option so that you can work through this with a professional's help.",1,False

Stealthing is especially heinous because you think you're safe and they open you up to the possibility of STDs and unwanted pregnancies.

It's wrong and if you feel up to it, you should report it. There's a lot of flaws in the justice systems pretty much everywhere when if comes to dealing with sexual assault but change is always important to try to push forward even if it's just a millimeter at a time. A lot of men continue to get away with various forms of sexual assault because society lets them and because they downplay or intimidate their victims to not doing anything about it.

Please talk to this person about boundaries, and how no means no full stop. My personal experience, if they convince you to change your mind once they're gonna do it again and push harder/not let it go until it's a situation you're really not cool with. 

If they start pressuring you again and you don't want to do anything, point out what they're doing. Don't let them make you feel bad about it or keep pressuring you, and if they do, stand up and leave.

My answer: yes 1000% this is sexual assault it isn’t even blurred lines it IS assault because

1. You were drunk AND told him you were drunk
2. He emotionally manipulated you and tried gaslighting you by saying you wanted it
3. YOU LITERALLY SAID NO AND THAT YOU DIDN’T WANT TO HAVE SEX there’s no ifs or buts here u literally made it entirely clear. Saying no means no full stop, even if you then stop saying it or say yes it means nothing. The first no is the final and only no needed. 
4. Even him masturbating and touching u is wrong and assault.  

Plus the fact that u literally cried I’m so sorry u had to go through that! Stay away from this guy and if u can definitely tell him it is wrong (and block him) and tell anyone else so they know to stay away. I hope you can find the support u need to start to process and feel better!",1,False

I can’t recall the statistic, but data shows that most sexual assaults occur by someone who the victim trusts. My advice to you is to see a psychologist, and look into pro bono options if you can’t afford one. You need psychological care as what you’ve been through is a trauma, and our minds need medical care, just like the rest of our body, after a trauma has happened to our body. It also helps to talk with a trusted friend or just to vent, like you’re doing now! So good for you for reaching out, and recognizing that your mental health is in need.

Yes she said it felt good but that’s bc she was in shock and was very confused about the decision. Just bc you don’t want it doesn’t mean something can’t feel good. It’s scary you don’t think this is rape!,1,False
o0j4ce,Outside_Violinist140@1,2,[deleted],"She literally asked if it was or not and I stated no. It’s obvious here that the definition of rape to people on this sub varies.

It would be different if OP wasn’t asking, and instead straight up telling us they were raped rather than asking and providing details why.",1,False
o0j4ce,,0,you-create-energy,"This is why it is so important for you to figure out how *you* feel about it and thus what *you* want to call it. 

""I don't think we're going to have sex tonight"" requires some interpretation. Depending on the intonation it could be interpreted as ""I haven't made up my mind yet"". It's not a clear cut no. I'm not saying you did anything wrong, just trying to make objective observations. I don't hear you saying you made any nonverbal signs you didn't want to have sex. I think when two people are making out naked and have a sexual history together, it leaves a pretty strong implication in the air that sex might happen. Without a clear ""no I don't want to have sex"", I can see how he might have thought you changed your mind. Of course, the respectful thing to do would have been to check in with you again before penetrating you. That was a boundary violation. It certainly wasn't rape in the legal sense. You don't sound traumatized, although it is difficult to tell through written text. I'd say how you want to interpret that is up to you. A candid conversation with him about it might give some insight into his state of mind.

I am curious why you didn't feel you could say ""I don't want to have sex'. You had several opportunities and it doesn't sound like he was being threatening or coercive. Was something stopping you? Or were you still making up your mind?

In the end you had a night of passion that you enjoyed. That is nothing to feel bad about. If it's a good memory, then enjoy it for what it is. Just keep in mind this guy will push boundaries. He isn't careful about consent. If that is exciting to you, no one should shame you for it. Just be aware of that if you decide to make yourself vulnerable to him again.",-1,False

o0j4ce,Ok-Examination3897@1,2,Various-Committee-11,"The best way I can describe the my brain processing throughout the moments of 1) me saying no, 2) him sticking it in, 3) me thinking ""what the fuck just happened"", and then 4) proceeding to carry on with it and just go ahead like everything is fine is kind of like my brain just ""switched gears"".

Like:

Option 1 - not having sex, what I wanted, was out of the question because he already put his dick in me. So then I had the choice of either

Option 2 - push him off of me and tell him that was not okay, which would have undoubtedly been awkward at least, and scary at worst; OR

Option 3 - carry on. 

And since I was already aroused, it was already in, he was already continuing to have sex with me, our mouths were already kissing, was the 'Path of Least Resistence' and so I went with that one. 

To sum all that up, this is along the lines of what my thought process was like: 

""If I push him off of me because he just stuck his dick in me without my consent, then I automatically am accpeting and admitting that what just occured was unconsentual penetration and sex, in other words, rapen. BUT, if I just ""go with the flow"" of what's already in progress then hey, it's not that bit of a deal - besides, I've been enjoying everything else so far, right? Why not carry on.""

Also, I already mentioned in another reply that I have issues standing up for myself, especially in situations like this, so that's something I need to work on. And I need to talk to him about this as well.

But yeah, I think that's kind of how my brain processes the situation in the moment. Hopefully that kind of makes sense. Maybe others can relate. I don't think that was the right way to go about things, but it was like a flight-or-fight, instinctive, kind of response that I had like 2 seconds to make.",2,True

But if you don’t, it’s still never your fault",1,False
o0j4ce,[deleted]@0,1,Various-Committee-11,"Perhaps, but again, I said clearly said no and he agreed. Also, like I said in another reply, these same behaviours have evident in past circumstances, however the consequences of them were less severe so it was something I kind of just rationalized and excused. However, doing so has led to this now though so I defintiely need to talk to him.

Also, even if that was how he interpreted it, it's still not okay because I said no and that's what he should have listened to. It was also a no with a very serious reason attached to it (disclaimer though: I'm not saying a reason needs to be given for a no to be valid), the reason being that I was not on birth control and we had no other form of protection. That's clearly (at least to me) a no, not like a case where you say no but then you proceed to tease the person and give other clear signs that you want to have sex, you know what I mean? Hopefully that made sense, I'm not sure. 

Saying all that though just really makes me wonder why he thought it was okay to do what he did, because the no was so clear. I can understand how afterwards, when we continued to have sex and I was into it, that he would not perceive anything to be wrong but IN THAT MOMENT (not yelling, just emphasizing and Idk how to italicize lol) between me saying ""no"" and him sticking it in - there was nothing confusing about the messages I was sending there. I said no and a very brief moment later he stuck it in. That's the really confusing part to me, as to why he thought it was okay.

o0j4ce,,0,TuffyManzer,"Yes it was because you had already said no but on the other hand you did continue. It's partially to blame on you but most of it is on him. Just because you're still aroused doesn't mean that it wasn't consensual, that's our bodies way of acting. Even with us guys we still get aroused even with being sexually assaulted, it's natural for our bodies to act like that.

o0j4ce,NotCinny@1,2,Various-Committee-11,"Yeah he definitely violated my boundaries, I see that now. It's just so conflicting to think that I enjoyed something (rape) that is such a terrible thing, ya know? Kind of shameful tbh",6,True
o0j4ce,TuffyManzer@0,1,Various-Committee-11,"I wouldn't say the blame is partially on me, but I do think that there are different actions I could have taken that would have resulted in me not having him violate my boundaries (I.e. not staying over, assertively and bluntly saying no or stop) but that being said, he's my friend, and i trusted that if i said ""no"" in an manner he would abide by that, especially since he said okay. It's like- yes, I could have done things differently that may have prevented the situation or ended it sooner, but, I me saying No in the first place should have been enough to prevent any other action from needing to be taken? So I guess I'm kind of answering my own question here, that it was in fact rape, but I'm not (partially because Im not ready to and I'm stilling figuring this out) assigning a value judgement onto him because of this circumstance. I definitely agree that I need to talk to him about this and my boundaries. And it would be helpful to have him explain why he did what he did, what his intentions were, or why he thought it was okay.

And yeah, I understand where you're coming from. I know this is something that would (most likely) never win a case in court. But this is also, most definitely, not something that I want to nor feel the need to involve the legal system with. Me asking this question was more so to have clarity for myself, and honestly, so that when I do talk to him, I can feel confident and validated in my feelings of feeling violated. So that I don't disregard my own feelings because he persuades me otherwise (if that does happen, don't know if it will so I'm not trying to presume that). But I do know that when it comes to standing up for myself, especially in interpersonal relationship, is something I really struggle with so I really just wanted to know I wasn't like delusional or whatever (you know what I mean? I'm not sure if that was the right word).  

I'm definitely gonna take the advice of talking to him and setting boundaries, honestly something I should have done before last night, but again, I've been scared to stand up for myself.

Ppl always act like others can pick up on hints or gestures but it's really hard to tell exactly what it means and ppl don't want to push boundaries, so more then likely he took it wrong and didn't know.

Whilst you did not object or refuse and some may use the ""froze"" excuse, I have liturally just read a story in here in which a poor girl was beaten, humiliated and wape up to being raped by her attackers and requiring hospital treatment and having had to move cities

I have commented on the post so you can read for yourselves by seing my replies 

But like you said, you was actively participating, you enjoyed it, I would say you might of been shocked by his behaviour as being out of the norm or what you have come to expect from him but by the sounds of it it was a case of two people who are fwb having rough sex

If it were where you was intoxicated unable to give concent, threatened, black mailed, harmed, groomed or under aged sex then yes I'd agree it was rape

But the people on this comment section appear to be on a ""pick me"" or ""metoo"" campaign rather than assessing the facts and comparing the level of this sexual experience to that of others and also where the law sits, whilst it varies from nation to nation, the over all consensus is without concent

And whilst the media often portrays silence as ""non consent"" a if we use the legal system as to determine concent and lawful actions then

It only affects fuel to the fire which probably resulted in him being even more lustful then before. 

Anyways I'm not excusing what he did especially since you have said you have boundaries multiple times but just know that men are being bombarded with sex everywhere and he may have been repressing it or again been too lustful due to Porn.

Best to have some more deep deep convos with him and actually discuss celibacy and being less lustful. Tell him to stop watching porn (he may deny it but I gaurentee he uses it). 

If you are waiting until marriage because of your faith then maybe go to a church or wherever with him and reassure why you're celibate in the first place.",1,False
nsdm42,,0,[deleted],"I am so, so sorry this happened to you. I went through something similar with my ex-bf (though I now know he is my ex-abuser not ex-bf).

I completely disagree with the other comment (no hate though). People who assault do it NOT because of lust but because of control. It's sickening - to them, hurting someone makes them feel powerful and in control. Porn is NOT an excuse for assault (but I do agree that it is very harmful).

You cannot *convince* your ex-bf to respect your boundaries by taking him to church or something. It is *his choice* to respect you. It is NOT your responsibility to make him listen to you. You did everything right by telling him your boundaries. The fault is his and his alone - not you, not porn, not lust.

Also, wtf?! How do cheek kisses differ from breasts?!?! He knows exactly how they differ but was trying to manipulate and confuse you into giving in to him (called coercion, which also falls under assault).

I did the same as you. I told my ex what my boundaries were. I told him about my faith. He told me he respected that, and then he went on to sexually abuse me the entire relationship. I also thought that abuse was a ""mistake and unintentional."" I thought it was my fault. I thought that maybe I did not clearly tell him my boundaries, maybe it was a misunderstanding. But after leaving the relationship, I realized all those times he told me I wasn't clear enough to him was him blaming me for his actions. I was clear, and he gaslit me into thinking I was responsible for him abusing me.

I finally broke up with him, and my ex did the same as yours. Crying, promising it won't happen again. He even told me verbatim ""I assaulted you and didn't even know."" ugghhh. These words are just manipulation. Your ex does not mean a word he says. If he did, for starters, he wouldn't blame or guilt you for feeling distant.

My ex also messaged all my friends and told them lies about why we broke up, and I also ended up talking to my ""friends"" about what happened to clarify the truth (unfortunately most have sided with him). What a horrible way to come out about what happened to you to others. I also went through periods of wishing others did not know. I'm so sorry you were not able to safely explain what happened to you in your own time.

I'm so sorry your friends are not supporting you very much, even though they sided with you. Please know there is absolutely no wisdom in what happened to you. Being assaulted and traumatized is not a lesson to learn. It is painful and unfair and should never have happened. And your friend saying ""choose someone better next time"" is classic victim-blaming. It is not your fault. You did not choose this.

I'm also very sorry you cannot afford therapy, but don't let that discourage you from healing. You can also make progress on your own. ***Everyone heals differently, so I don't know if this will help you.*** But here are some non-therapy things that helped me.

\- support from someone: for me, it was my mom. Maybe you have someone other than your friends (who either don't understand or don't care enough to put the time in) to support you? The least they could do is just listen and validate you.

\- Learning about manipulation/abuse: What happened to you is similar to me, so I think that there may have been other issues in your relationship that you have not realized yet. This link really helped me understand who I truly was dealing with. Learning who I was with helped validate what I went through and decreased some of the confusion I felt. [http://www.hiddenhurt.co.uk/warning\_signs.html](http://www.hiddenhurt.co.uk/warning_signs.html)

\- Taking time for myself: Before the assault and abuse, I was a very, very busy person. I tried to do the most, but quickly realized that was not an option for me after the abuse. I was too depressed to even get out of bed for a while. It really helped me to decrease the amount of things I was doing so that I had the space to just be, whether it was crying or sleeping. It's what I needed at that time.

\- Educating myself on trauma: the books ""the body keeps the score"" by Bessel van der Kolk, ""Trauma and Recovery"" by Judith Lewis Herman, and ""The Gift of Fear"" by Gavin de Becker have given me clarity on what I am going through, which has helped validate my experience and helped me learn a little on how to help myself.

**\*\*\* ""The Gift of Fear"" begins with a descriptive enough recount of SA so save that for later or skip that part if needed. I have not finished the book, so I don't know if there are other parts of the book to take note of.**

\- Keeping a checklist: It was very difficult for me to get through the day and take care of myself. I could not think at all. A checklist helped with that. When I would wake up, I'd feel so out of it and not know what to do. Then I'd look at my checklist and see ""oh brush my teeth okay. Now what? Oh eat something."" etc. This just helped me get through the day.

\- Be patient with yourself: In the checklist, I'd give myself LOTS of room and breaks. I basically had half a day allotted to resting. Other times, I felt upset with myself for still being depressed and sad that it happened. It can be hard, but give yourself time and patience to get through each day.

\- Express your emotions: This was **so key** for me. If I wanted to cry, I did. If I wanted to break things, I did. Obviously, do not harm yourself, but allow yourself to let out those difficult emotions. I also did this through making art and playing and singing songs that I related to (The artist Fiona Apple was a literal lifesaver). I journaled a bit, but that was difficult for me so I have not kept up with it. I took long drives because I needed the scenery. I also took up self-defense and kickboxing which was soooo good. I imagined punching my abuser when I punched the bag, which felt amazing haha.

\- Start getting to know yourself again: If you are like me, your self-identity may be confusing to you. I have not known who I am for some time, particularly because his crossing my boundaries has also made me feel so dirty like there was something wrong with me. I went into the relationship thinking I would never experience what I experienced. However, I did, and now I think who the fuck am I???? Learning who I am by starting new hobbies (I've started gardening), painting my room I color I have learned I like, etc. has helped me feel solid in myself, which is helping me heal as well and learn that I am who I am and that means I am not dirty. I am x, y, z, and that does not include being dirty. Keep in mind this won't be immediate. It has taken me a LONG time to get here, and there are still days where I go back to feeling that way.

\- Know that healing is cyclical: When I would have 1 good moment/day and then go back to feeling bad, I would lose hope, and my healing would regress. I've learned now that healing is cyclical and there are good days and bad days. The hope is that as we heal, the good days will increase and the bad days will decrease and we can handle bad days and enjoy good days.

\- Go no contact: This was also **key** for me. If you have not already, go no contact. Block him on social media. Block his number. Keep distance with mutual friends who may still hang out with him. People like that are like that phrase about the devil - give them an inch and they'll take the whole mile. Once I finally had space from him, I was able to focus on myself and healing.

\- Tips from my therapist: to get me through the week, she recommends journaling. I told her I found it difficult to journal. Her advice is to do it in the morning when you are fresh and journal about a color that comes to mind and just write what comes from that. She also recommends meditating - like highly recommends it. There are apps that can walk you through that and videos on youtube too that you can do. You can also follow it with yoga. I have not done it yet bc it is triggering for me. She has given me a breathing exercise that helps me calm down. Breathe in for 6 seconds, hold for 6 seconds, breathe out for 6 seconds, hold for 6 seconds, and repeat this 3x. It didn't help that much at first but now I am able to pause my racing thoughts and just breathe which helps.

I know this is a lot. I hope it is not overwhelming and helps. I am so sorry you have gone through this. Remember, you are stronger than you know. Even though it is hard and you may feel like you will never get better, you will get through this.",1,False

basically, that’s not a lot of brain to work with. 

he doesn’t get to decide whether it was sexual assault based on **his** feelings about you, nor how those feelings made you feel. like, is he living in your head and have experienced those feelings with you and as you? is he a wizard? omniscient? a mind reader? **oh my, is he god, and we all just didn’t know he was here?** 🙄😒

**his** feelings decided that you were uncomfortable about them (those feelings couldn’t even think it was, idk, the fact that he was pinning you down and crossing a huge fuckin boundary that was making you feel uncomfortable?), and even so, **his** feelings chose to ignore that discomfort just so he could pleasure himself.  **his** feelings were what drove him to assault you when you told him to let you go and let you leave. so **his** feelings have no place in this decision. 

yours do. and if **your** feelings say it’s sexual assault, then it is. 

a sexual assault care centre will also say the same thing, because by law (at least in my country, where even sexual assault laws are horrid; hopefully yours protect women more), everything from him pinning you down and purposefully going against your consent, to rubbing his flaccid tootsie roll-sized dick against you for a prolonged period of time (again, against your consent), to forcing a kiss on you (yet again, against your consent, three times now) are actions of sexual assault.

some people actually just freze when something like this happen.
      Because 1 they don't know how to react 
         and 2 they're hoping this is actually not really happening,

Btw did he ever acted inappropriate twords you before like did something that made you feel uncomfortable looked at you in a certain way. 
It's possible that he actually has been into you(which would be DISGUSTING)
And what dose he think about family having inappropriate relations 

and how is he acting now dose he show remorse.
 did he say sorry just for the sake of it or did he actually mean it. And was he sleep acting or was he wide awake and aware of what he was doing,


and most importantly what dose he think of you.

You are brother and sister he crossed the line he disrespected that beautiful relationship. He the one who's wrong and he's the who's at fault.
You are as innocent in this in this as a baby who's now born.

That guy is a garbage human and he sounds dangerous.

I would be really upset to and I think it's very understandable that you are still struggling with this. 
Do you have access to counseling? I think that would be helpful so they can help you heal from this traumatic event. 


I've been through experiences that were much more of a gray area and I am still bothered by it.  
My experiences were non-violent, no one was rough with me, like a friend dry humping me after I passed out drunk and waking up to it happening. Which was pretty alarming at the time especially because I thought we were just friends. 
Another time I was really drunk and he pulled me onto the couch with him. He spooned me then started groping me. I was super messed up but it seemed like it went on for 5-10 min.  I let it happen at first, I just laid there motionless. I didn't know what to do, I froze and didn't say anything. Then he started taking off my pants and I snapped out of it said I was too drunk and quickly left the room. Luckily he didn't follow me or pursue it any further. 
There was no force or violence in my situation and honestly it still bothers me. There def was no consent tho, he just took advantage of my drunkenness. I figured he thought I'd be less likely to say no while I was trashed. 

He was a really good friend and I completely lost all trust in him. He made me feel violated. 

It took me years to acknowledge it as a violation of my trust and body. I still struggle to decide whether it was assault or not. Either way though I do know he was wrong and he took advantage of me. 

Sorry didn't mean to go so deep into my story. I just wanted you to know you're not alone and I understand that gross feeling of being violated. Its hard to shake. 

Its uncomfortable and unfortunately often comes with shame. I don't even know why, I know it wasn't my fault. So many women feel shame after being assaulted after something was done to them without their permission.

But you used your words to tell him you wanted him to stop, and situations like this can be so scary and confusing that you feel unable to get physical with the assaulter.

For me, all I can say is that trauma brain is the worst.

mx3nph,,0,linebreaker-bot,"&gt;This happened in 7th grade, I'm in high school right now, and at the time I had just gotten out of an extremely emotional manipulative friend ship, and to simplify that story it made it extremely hard for me to set clear boundaries for a extremely long time, I was also trying to figure out my sexuality and gender, along with that I was having a lot of issues with body image, and in general that year was extremely complicated for me. A few months after the friendship ended, I had invited 2 other friends over one had to leave early and i was left with the other friend, let's call her KC, and I went swimming with her. While we were swimming, KC kept touching my butt.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;it made me extremely uncomfortable but I though that a) if someone so pretty is attracted to ME I shouldn't tell her to stop and b) that if i really wasn't straight i should enjoy it. KC kept asking me if I liked it and I would just say ""I don't know"" or ""I guess"" and things like that. later we went inside and she asked if she could kiss me and I said no, because I hadn't kissed anyone before and i was extremely uncomfortable. after that we were watching a show together in my room and she had closed the door and she said that if she couldn't kiss me could she touch my chest and I didn't know what to say so I said yes and she started over my shirt but then she went under it and she kept asking me if I liked it and i wasn't responding and she kept doing it for a long time until my mom called us for dinner and my mom could tell something was wrong but she just thought we had gotten into an argument and she said that we should probably go and drop her off at her house because it was getting late, and my mom kept asking me about it and i kept saying that nothing happened.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;I tried not to think about that day for a long time but i remembered it recently and I've been thinking a lot about it and i think it may have been sexual assault but I'm not sure because i technically said yes.

mwb0yj,,0,linebreaker-bot,"&gt;When I was 7-8 me and my brother went to my grandma's house a lot since we were neighbors and still are. During that time my cousin's parents were going through a divorce so he stayed there a lot. When we came over we would play Minecraft with him. It was fun which is what made me still go... He started watching some not so child friendly things. During this time he was 11-12. Children copy things they see so you might know where this is going. He started to touch me... First the legs and then inside my pants... My brother was younger than me and was scared of him. My cousin, let's call him Sean. Sean would lock me in with him and then touch me.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;In the close. Outside the closet. And once in my own house. He wouldn't stop. Why I didn't tell anyone? I thought I was gonna get in trouble. I thought it was my fault. One day though, he decided he was gonna finally do it. You know what I mean. He didn't lock the door though. He grabbed me and kissed e and then touched me. I was terrified. But that day it was all over. My brother ran to my grandma who didn't know about any of this. She told him to stop and she told e to leave. He chased me and my brother down the stairs and almost all the way to my house. I think my grandma told him something 'cause he never did it again.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;As far as she was concerned, this was a one time thing. She never knew what else he did to me. I was traumatized. In fear I didn't tell anyone so for a while only my brother knew. We still hung out with him but he didn't touch me after that but it was awkward. I am now older an I finally told my mom. She was petrified and told me she was gonna talk to my uncle about it. He said he was gonna talk to my cousin about it. I had confronted him last year about it and he just told me he didn't remember doing that. I have a lot of body issues now and opening up to people isn't my best characteristic.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;I do wanna know tho.. Is what he did considered sexual assault? Was I molested? I don't really know so pls tell me. Sorry this was long but I needed to get this out of my chest. Btw, my dad doesn't know. Should I tell him? If yes, how? Thanks for reading this.

Looks like he is pedophile and pervert,  maybe sex and porn addict as well and a manipulator

mnm54f,,0,[deleted],"Yeah, I’d say you were groomed, and sexually molested, assaulted many times over a period of time.
You didn’t do anything about it or understand it because you were too young. Even showing a child porn is highly illegal, but of course touching you and all that too is assault, as is engaging in sex acts with you while you were asleep.
Kids are very resilient. You did what most kids would do. You kept going about kid stuff. You didn’t know what he was doing WAS NOT kid stuff. And you probably also didn’t want to (subconsciously) risk rejection or division in your family. Little kids need the adults in their lives to survive, and they know it, and when an adult who should be a source of protection and safety becomes a perpetrator it is confusing to the child, who naturally tries to rationalize it.
I’m really sorry that happened. You would benefit from a trauma therapist.
Whether or not you tell anyone in your family is a 100% personal decision, but I just wanted you to know as well-I can’t guarantee anyone’s behavior, but family members will often react with denial. So just be prepared for that. Take care.

Many kids naturally trust the older figures in their lives, and so when something happens it can seem fine to you until you are old enough to realize. It’s important that you know that nothing he did was your fault or happened because you acted a certain way. You were a kid. 
I believe that he sexually assaulted and abuse you. Ultimately you are the only one able to define your experiences, so if you don’t want to label it that’s completely alright. But what he did was not okay. Calling it sexual assault is completely valid in this circumstance, so if that’s how you feel then call it that.

My cousin was 20/21 at the time. He was my absolute favorite cousin so I easily grew a family bond with him. We would watch movies and play video games in his room. My cousin would slowly expose me to the sexual world the more I was around him. He would sneakily show me porn, touch my private parts while I sat on his lap, crawl into my bed and perform oral and have me do it to him. I didn't think anything of it but I knew it was supposed to be sneaky.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;I just thought what we were doing was supposed to be playfulness fun. I didn't think it was malicious intended. I was not properly learned about sex education yet. The last ever time he touched me was when I was 10, I woke up to him staring at me with my pants gone &amp; a hickey on my chest ( I remember feeling disgusted and actually old enough to know what he did was odd.) I finally came to realization that what he doing was wrong and disgusting. I suddenly became so angry and rude to him ( he made my family look at me like a bad/rude cousin because of my attitude) They knew nothing about it. It stopped because I think he realized I was too old and aware.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;For years ive felt so guilty because why didn't I FEEL abused or disgust when it was happening? was it bc I was too young? did he groom me? is this considered sexual assault? I know I was too young to consent but I don't fully understand. Im 18 now and there's not a day of where I stare into confusion and think about it. (note: Ive been addicted to pornography for years since he exposed me to it) . I appreciate any feedback/questions or anyone who takes the time to respond I know it can feel eerie to read I just don't want to be in denial. What's the correct term to describe the situation?

mh0wq7,the_fisharedrowning_@1,2,armita-,"I feel the same way. There's just this comfort in knowing that you aren't alone, that you can relate to someone. And being told that it's normal seriously fucks you up mentally. Especially by your own family. In my case my mom stopped when I started to tell her that I'm a 'grown woman' now (when I was around 7) and I didn't even think that it was wrong back then. Maybe you can tell your grandmother that your chest hurts when someone touches it because it's growing? That excuse mostly works because some peoples chests actually hurt when touched (if you are around the age of 10-14). be very careful in your tone though, In my case if I made my mom feel like she was doing something wrong I would get screamed at and hit. If she has a history of directly and/or indirectly harming you physically/mentally, please try to choose your words very carefully. You can use the following 'excuses' (aka escape routes) based on your grandma's personality and behavior: 

""my chest is growing so it kinda hurts when you touch it"" mostly effective with a slightly hurt/ not offended/ happy and calm tone. I would advise you to not use an offended/ angry tone when saying it because it may make the person aggressive and violent.

""hey granny, don't you think that I'm a bit too old for this now?"" again, use it in a tone that suggests calmness but a bit of discomfort. Body language is the key, so try to rub your neck nervously a little or shift around uncomfortably. I wouldn't suggest this if she is violent/abusive in any way, abusers tend to either get extremely offended or joyful in seeing their victims nervous and/or afraid though I don't think that your grandmother is like that.

try to reason with her while keeping your cool. Also sorry for the bad English, It ain't my first language.",2,False

m6w7wu,,0,linebreaker-bot,"&gt;I’ve recently had an uncomfortable encounter with a woman that has left me confused and humiliated. It happened a few months ago but basically my boyfriend and my boyfriends friends and his girlfriend met us on an out of town trip. We all went to this hot springs and I ended up getting very drunk. For a little reference, I’m straight, I’ve never been attracted to females sexually or otherwise. I’m very pro women and support women and love empowering women but I am not in any way sexually attracted to women. Anyways, we were about to leave the hot springs and we all went to go rinse off and change and leave. Me and her went into the locker room and it gets blurry from there.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Alcohol plus the hot springs had made me pretty inebriated to the point I was almost blackout drunk. The next thing I knew we wound up in one shower together and my bathing suit was off. Also for reference, she was not drunk. I have bits and pieces of remembering her touching kissing and going down on me and feeling very uneasy uncomfortable and scared and just thinking “this shouldn’t be happening I want this to stop” I don’t remember leaving the hot springs or the drive back which was about an hour back to our hotel. As soon and me and my boyfriend got to our room I burst out crying and went to go take another shower. My boyfriend knew something bad had happened and just sat with me in the shower with his clothes on while I sobbed.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;He thought I had cheated on him with her at first and was very upset with me which just made me more confused and upset but once I was able to choke out the feeling of it and how upset I was he understood and was very caring and supportive. I didn’t think another woman could sexually me. I’d never heard of it happening and I felt very guilty, convincing myself it couldn’t be assault and that I was just a terrible girlfriend and it made me question a lot of things about myself. I was just confused about what happened and still am. It’s very hard for me to talk about it with people.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;It’s still hard to think about. I don’t know if I consented at any point. I tried to brush it off as drunk girl fun but this wasn’t that. I had only met her once before this trip so we weren’t close at all. I love my boyfriend very much. I still am hesitant to call it sexual assault. I know it wasn’t right but I’m still very confused and any advice or similar experiences would be very helpful. Thank you if you took the time to read this

m3aewt,,0,linebreaker-bot,"&gt;Hey guys, I recently had an incident occur with a guy last semester on my college campus. I had been chatting with this guy for a bit over Snapchat and he seemed friendly so I wasn’t worried. Eventually, he started getting flirtatious and I brushed it off and never made any advancements towards him hoping he would give up. He kept wanting to meeting up and hang out, and I was hopefully that if I said yes and kept it friendly then he would understand I wasn’t interested in anything serious. We soon plan to meet up one evening at my dorm room and we sit around for quite a few hours just chatting and having a good time. Everything seems normal and I wasn’t worried.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;I soon decide I want to clear the air and let him know I am not quite ready for anything serious, but I also tell him that he seems really nice but right now just isn’t the right time for me. It didn’t mean in the future I couldn’t be ready, but for now I wasn’t. He accepts this and I was grateful, but he did ask if he could at least kiss me. Against my better judgement I let him, this led to more touching. It eventually lead to him performing oral sex on me etc. In the moment it felt good but I eventually felt that I wasn’t in the mood and I knew I needed to tell him I didn’t want to have sex.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;So, I sat up and straight up told him I didn’t want to have sex, I wasn’t ready and he said he understood. Unfortunately, because it was now approaching close to 2am or later I was getting really tired. I tried to get him to stop by curling up away from him and tried to get under my blanket hoping he would get the message to leave and that I was over it. He didn’t though, and even tried to open my legs back up even after I tried to show him I wasn’t interested anymore. After this, I know I fell asleep at some point because I woke up to this pain down there of him trying to push himself into me but being unsuccessful probably because I was a virgin.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Idk how he didn’t know I had fallen asleep since I wasn’t responding. The moment I realized what was happening my body froze and I couldn’t breathe. I’m not sure if that’s a normal reaction, but I was silently crying at this point, but he don’t know because I was on my stomach and my face was facing away from his. I just remember this fear coursing through my body the whole time. He eventually finishes on my back area and packs up and leaves. I remember being to scared to stand up, but when I eventually did I went into a straight panic attack and had to text my friend out of sheer distress.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;I feel so guilty b/c I feel I gave him mixed signals. I still haven’t talked to anyone at my college regarding this incident from last semester and I’m still not sure if it will be taken serious if reported. Could I please get some advice?

ly81e4,,0,KatjaE,"Hi there! 
Firstly, I’m really sorry this happened to you. I want to preface I’m a woman with some minor and adult SA experience, but you know yourself and the situation best, so take my advice with a grain of salt. 

I would 100% call this sexual assault (I don’t believe in downplaying it based on how you feel about it now - but I’m glad it’s not weighing on you too much :)). Your reaction is what’s key to me here. Freezing up (flight, fight or freeZe - all normal responses to trauma), is certainly your body response to something happening to you that’s too overwhelming to grasp. You also repeatedly denied her advances and said no multiple times. So not only did she not listen to you, she completely violated your verbal and physical boundaries (which takes it beyond harassment). Also, normal girls don’t just grab men’s dicks unless there is a clear vibe! (Aka you haven’t said no multiple times) - even if it is 8th grade and everyone is horny! This isn’t normal at all. I’m not too surprised your friends, especially men, reacted this way. It’s not a secret that SA on men/boys is treated utterly different by everyone vs SA on women/girls (sadly).

I hope this helps and Wishing you the best on your path forward!",2,False

lxjnaz,,0,linebreaker-bot,"&gt;So I really have no clue if I was sexually abused or not or if it was a dream, or if it was kids being kids. I’ve had memories that I’ve only realised were dreams YEARS later when I’ve spoken to a friend who was in the ‘memory’ and they’ve said what? That never happened?? Lol. So I feel like my brain is really messed with dreams and reality. I had a kinda messed up childhood with my parents cheating on each other and still living together despite being divorced, so my memories are very hazy, really have no memory of me being a kid at ALL. But throughout the years at random times in my life I get this random memory (or dream) of me and my brother (I want to be sick typing this, and have been sick multiple times at the thought of this) ‘fooling around’ naked.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;This is only a single memory, not a recurring thing. There was no penetration or anything. But the memory of the sexual act is so strong but I can’t SEE the memory at all but almost just feel it ? (Not sexually but it’s like the memory isn’t tangible but I can feel it happened idk if that makes sense). Anyway, I’ve recently been through a really hard time with my anxiety and these memories keep popping up over this week, the same memory reoccurring. Then it leads me to other memories of sex related stuff that made me uncomfortable, like kissing guys or seeing my mum kiss her boyfriend etc and I’ve just felt so gross and haven’t been able to eat properly for a week.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;My issue is, I don’t even know if it was a dream or a memory or sexual assault. I am looking into potentially seeing a therapist, I have one now but I think it’d be too much for her, she isn’t specialised in abuse or anything. so I may see a new one and it may be easier to disclose these gross memories to them. But I really don’t know what to do going forward, it’s causing be debilitating anxiety and I just want to cry all day at the thoughts that this even possibly occurred??

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;I’ve had a great relationship with my brother, we’re only a year and a bit apart and I can’t ever imagine something like this happening? I don’t want our relationship to be ruined and I see him frequently and don’t attach him at all to the boy this happened with all those years ago. I reckon we would have been between the ages of 3-7 when this occurred. I can’t imagine us being much older as I think I really would have remembered it more clearly idk. I just don’t want my relationship with my brother or family ruined at all cos I love them so much. I also have a boyfriend and I haven’t been able to be intimate with him and I just put it down to my anxiety but it could be this??

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;The thing is what would I even tell him. Oh I think me and my brother had an incestous relationship this one time?? Or maybe he abused me ?? Like wtf. Do I ask my brother if he remembers this happening? Do I talk to my family about this? I don’t want them to think I’m crazy OR ruin our relationship if it turns out to be true and my whole family is fractured by this. I just don’t know how to move forward and what to do. It could literally be a dream!

lx6x3r,,0,tobeanonymousforchoc,"I stayed with my bf. Far longer than I should have. The situation was almost identical, I knew he didn't understand the severity of what he had done to me but let me just say,

Just because you understand why he did it doesn't excuse the fact he did it.

It doesn't matter If you know he doesn't understand, he assaulted you. He doesn't understand because not all assaulters do. Some assaulters dont know what they're doing is wrong, they always have some excuse as to why what they did wasnt actually sexual assault and play the innocent bystander. Your boyfriend is no different from thousands of other abusers. 

Dont make my mistake. I stayed with my bf, I got ""roughed up"" outside a mall in a parking lot because I said no when he tried to kiss me. I then found out after I broke up with him (after a very uncomfortable date, once again that was very questionable) that he had raped his ex-girlfriend. I'm not saying your bf definitely assaulted another person but it's not a far stretch. 

It's a common thing that we stay with those that assaulted us, it happens when we cant handle what's happened to us so we desensitize ourselves as a defense mechanism and then continue to associate with our abusers (in any capacity) to try and further that desensitization.

You cant feel your emotions and trauma vividly because your brain knows that if you experienced it in the very vulnerable position you're in, you will not be able to handle it. Trauma is a very sensitive thing, having to re-live it in the presence of the person that assaulted you? Big no no. Your brain won't do that to you. 

You cant work through your trauma if you're still being traumatized. Being in his presence and being in a relationship with him cant, not harm you. 

One time is all it takes to destroy your life, so why cant it destroy his too? Why are you carrying the full burden of being a victim? It's not your fault, it's his. The assaulter should carry the burden so bury him with it. 

I will never judge another person for doing what I've done but I promise you, this will never go away. You will never forget and he will never remember. You need to get out of this relationship as fast as you can. You may not be able to recognize other abuse behaviours he displays because your too close to him. 

My dms are always open for further discussion about this, if you need it. I wish you the best.",6,False
lx6x3r,tobeanonymousforchoc@0,1,tobeanonymousforchoc,"Another thing, because he assaulted you, there is an irreversible power dynamic that's been created. He will always have more power and influence over you then you could ever hope to have on him. Some people are okay with an uneven power dynamic in a relationship but in this context, that can be very dangerous. The power he have over you may not be apparent but I think, you should consider what you would do and say for this man and this relationship. You've already ignored your feelings and trauma to just be with him, how much further will you take it or could you take it, just for him?",5,False
lx6x3r,,0,[deleted],"Have you talked to him about it yet? I think what happens from here depends a lot on whether he understands it was wrong and feels remorse or brushes it off and feels no remorse. In my experience, if he is the latter sort of person when you're telling him you're hurting, then that means HIS EGO comes first, always. Before you, before anyone else, and even before himself and the opportunities he'll have to grow in life. It might be hard to accept but it's even harder to live with.

Either way, please don't keep pushing aside your OWN feelings. Hope that helps a little.",2,False
lx6x3r,[deleted]@0,1,Gullible_Tale_1626,"Yeah, we talked about it a few months after it happened I think? Not too long after for sure. His behaviour then was somewhat questionable on the whole but he did explicitly agree it was a serious thing that happened and he was sorry. I honestly can't remember it all now because I've kind of detached from the earlier stages of our relationship and I see him as a different person then to who he is now. I think that has really confused me, especially because he seems do different now to then as well. He did a few odd things in the few months after and ignored something pretty serious that I told him was a consequence of it which I thought was strange but ever since then everything has been very consensual. Like he's freaked out so many times if I look too serious during intimate times because he thinks he's doing something wrong. 

So overall I think that he's grown massively since the incident but when I brought up things I was struggling with the other day and included that he didn't mention it at all and focused on the other things I said. He always looks very serious when I talk about the impact it had on me so I think he knows it wasn't okay but I'm not actually sure if he understands how deeply it affected me and how much it's shaped me in terms of how I feel in the relationship and how I handle things. I also think that's partly to do with him maybe not being able to process and accept that he did that. He's very vocal about being against things like that so I think he genuinely can't deal with the fact that he did something of that nature.

I really want to be able to heal it while with him but I feel like you're right, you probably can't process a trauma when you're with that person.

There's been some small betrayals for me too, and I think I react to them so intensely because I've allowed him another chance and given him so much love even after he did something that I know was a trauma that has changed me.

lx6x3r,,0,you-create-energy,"This is a tricky one. It's rare that someone is capable of going that far and yet only does it once. It's not impossible, but it's rare. So one aspect of this is considering the risk of it happening again. It sounds like the risk might be low. I certainly hope so.

Another major issue is dealing with the violation that has already occurred. It sounds like you have been trying to deal with it through repression and avoidance, which can help in the short term. Unfortunately it rarely works as a long term strategy, because that trauma will have to be processed eventually. I recommend reaching out to a professional to help you in that process. It can be so difficult and confusing to navigate on our own. This will have an impact on your relationship. I think it is important to see remorse from him, an acknowledgment of how he wronged you. Has he ever expressed anything like that?",2,False
lx6x3r,you-create-energy@0,1,Gullible_Tale_1626,"I tried to reply earlier but lost what I wrote so I'll try and write it more quickly now.

Since that weird phase he's been completely different and nothing like that has ever happened again. He's shown remorse as well, especially quite recently and in that there have been loads of times we've been intimate where he's checked I'm okay if I look to serious and he's looked so worried when he does until I confirm it's all good. I really don't think it's going to happen again, he's fundamentally different now than he was then.

I really feel uncomfortable bringing it up because I don't want to make him feel bad but it really has affected me massively. I'm really struggling because of lockdown because I just feel so isolated with my feelings, and there's a whole mess of other things where I've basically used the repression and avoidance tactics so much that now just feeling completely overwhelmed.",2,True
lx6x3r,Gullible_Tale_1626@1,2,you-create-energy,"It is reassuring to hear the change you have seen in him. It sounds sincere based on your description, and I truly hope it is.

It is a tragic situation when two people love each other and something gets broken that can't be repaired. Unfortunately it does happen. I honestly think your best outlet will probably be to speak with a professional, if possible. I know it can be difficult to arrange. With anyone else you will have your hands full dealing with their reaction to your situation, which will leave very little room for dealing with your own reaction.

It sounds like the challenge in discussing it with him is finding a way to do it productively. What are you looking to get from discussing it with him? A professional would likely have a better strategy for this than I could come up with. One angle that might help is saying exactly what you said here, namely that his reaction since that event has been really helpful in restoring your trust. That you are having a difficult time separating out your feeling about this event from your overall state of mental health caused by the stress of the past year, as well as other situations you say you are repressing your reaction to. It's possible you would be still struggling even if that trauma had never occurred. There is no way to know for sure, but if you have suffered other traumas in your life then it is entirely possible. What could he do that would make you feel supported? If you have some specific and actionable ask from him, it will probably feel a lot more productive. If you need to vent, it will probably just shut him down. That's my best guess.

It also might help to tackle your overall mental health intentionally. Make space in your life for the things you enjoy. Give yourself something to look forward to. Make a good memory when you have a chance, to sustain you through the week. Do you think that might help?",2,False

I don't know if exactly have an outcome from talking to him I want, I think I just feel like I need to get it off my chest. I haven't really spoken in great detail to anyone about the changes I noticed in myself since it happened. I talk to him about everything so I think I want to talk to him about it more not because it involved him but because I would talk to him about it if it was caused by anyone else. I think just him listening would make me feel supported. I guess I want him to understand how much it affected me and remains something that affects me even though I've largely repressed it. I get more angry about certain things because it makes me think of that time and I know I wouldn't otherwise.

I do try to do things I enjoy but at this point I find it extremely difficult to feel happy when I'm on my own. There's just too much going on.

also its probably useful to let him know what he did, so he can have a chance to grow and prevent himself from doing it again...

I remember feeling some sort of panic a man was about to rape me so I decided to make the most out of the situation and when I told one of my friends they told me I probably wanted it and was just drunk - that is the thing thst kept me from accepting that that had been assault. For years I struggled, I still do, and it had been 8 years. 

What I'm trying to say is that you were basically blacked out drunk/high. There is no way on earth you could have consented, even if you think you did at the time, that is rape. It's hard to comprehend and understand. 

I hear a lot of people talk about fight/flight/freeze and recently my therapist brought up something called fond - a body reaction of trying to make the most out of a situation so you feel like you're in control and this bad thing is not happening. That's what happened to me and I believe that is what happened to you as well.

First of all, you should not be ashamed of yourself at all. People think that there's always this fight or flight reaction, but the truth is a lot of people just act like deer caught in headlights. You feel like you're unable to stop or say anything, no matter how much you want to fight back.

Secondly, you did not want it, you did not consent in any way. The fact that you gave him a blowjob even though you didn't want to could have been your way of trying to get the incident over and done with. You were pushed and pushed until you gave in, which can be seen as coerced consent. Whether he sees it or not, that is sexual assault.
And finally, he must have seen that you were uncomfortable in some way if you were not reciprocating his actions at all. Any respectable person would pick up on that instantly and put a stop to it, or at least ask if you wanted it to continue and I'm assuming that he didn't do that.

I mean I can’t judge how big the transgression between you two was. But it sounds like a quite normal miscommunication between you two of you never talked about consent before. 
Especially when you’re practicing even some light domination in bed it’s important to talk about consent extensively, have a safe word or non verbal signal that you want to stop. 

It sounds like you managed to have a good conversation as the result of it and he now has a better understanding of your needs. 

Don’t feel guilty for wanting to stay with him. Also don’t feel guilty if it takes a while to gain trust again.

PS: you didn’t go much into detail on what happened but from what you described, it doesn’t sound too extreme of a transgression to me.

jgdf4e,,0,ESPhotog,"I am a prosecutor who handles sex cases.  Depending upon the state you live in, your age alone might make the event criminal.  Statutory rape is based on the age of the victim; consent is not relevant because the law does not allow minors to consent to such acts.  As for the crime of rape where the issue of consent is central to the crime, the actions you described could suggest that you did consent.  By saying “could suggest” doesn’t mean I am saying you did consent, instead I am pointing out that others could see this as a consensual encounter, meaning there is doubt as to whether he engaged in unconsensual sex.  He will likely claim that you agreed to have sex; the fact you said “no” multiple times before eventually saying yes would be irrelevant in the eyes of some jurors absent evidence of duress on his part - such as threats if you didn’t change your mind.  Preying upon your psychological desires to please and not disappoint is very sick, but it likely would not rise to the level of duress. 

Because criminal cases must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, cases where doubt exists should not be filed.  As a prosecutor I can say this is a case my office would likely not file as a rape case - given your age however we would likely file a statutory rape case.  I do encourage you to file a police report.  More importantly, please seek some professional counseling - you have clearly been victimized and professionals can help you process all of this.

The comment about consent after saying you were out of it is also very uncomfortable. I think there were a lot of signs from anyone who understands consent especially with someone with sa trauma that this was not the way to go and it should have stopped. This is troubling, but both in the way that it went down and in the way that (I’m going to say this with a lot of care behind it) you may need to work on recognizing your boundaries and saying no, especially if they seem to push them. Once you say no, a no is a no is a no and it’s not to be pushed. If it’s not a hell yes and you feel like excited and ready to do all of that, it is a no. Everyone understanding that from now on is really important, and it’s okay to say no. I’m going to type it again just to emphasize it, It Is Okay To Say No. If the boundary isn’t respected *especially* after being said clearly, then it may be worth reevaluating if this relationship is healthy in this aspect of it.

Imo it’s worth talking about and setting boundaries up ahead of time (like “hey I have a hard time saying no, can we establish that if it’s not active engaging and enthusiastic it’s a no, a soft yes is still a no, please look out for me in the moment if I start being uncomfortable, I’m saying this ahead of time because I can panic in the moment”) when you’re ready. How that’s handled and how that goes over will probably tell you a lot, but communicating assertively is really important with that. I would try to do it calmly and would probably wait until it’s not such a raw feeling. I’ve been in your shoes before with similar situations, and I would try to not be hard on yourself for your fawn response. This doesn’t feel like it was healthy for sure. There are a few aspects to why that is, and I definitely feel like there were moments you tried to stop it without feeling able to say stop outright. I wish he would have recognized that or followed through on recognizing that, and I imagine you do too. Both of your communication and following through on boundaries with these things needs some work, and I’m not impressed with the way your bf handled it.


TLDR I would be extremely uncomfortable too, with what you’ve been through it’s very normal to respond this way, and what happened definitely wasn’t a perfect image of a healthy physical intimacy interaction.

He was clearly not taught to respect boundaries and that is not your fault. It is perfectly okay for you to have any feelings about this including strong feelings, mixed feelings, and confusion, as you were both just kids. I would suggest talking to a therapist or psychologist because they are trained to help you understand how you feel about it and how those experiences (along with everything else) has shaped you as a person.

You *DO NOT* have to feel weird if you don’t like something. You have your own boundaries and experiences and others should respect that especially since you have a csa background.
It is totally valid for you to ask your next sexual encounter to ask for consent before doing anything, e.g. „is it okay if I touch you here?“, „are fine with me doing xyz?“.
For some this might be a turnoff because it could break the immersion of the situation. But you shouldn’t worry about that. If they have a problem with asking consent then they are not the right person for you to hook up with.

None of what happened is your fault. It doesn’t matter that you didn’t vocally say ‘no’ because someone shouldn’t be doing this to you at all and the problem lies with them. You don’t need to scream or yell. People should not be touching you without a verbal enthusiastic ‘YES.’

Staying quiet about it isn't a good strategy for dealing with it. Make a fuss, be loud and be noticed when you do - run into the next room shouting ""he groped my chest"" - or be more explicit. Sometimes that can be difficult in certain cultures but the more shocking the better.

Most girls encounter something like this at some point as their bodies mature and boys become sexually attracted to them. Talk to your friends, see how they have reacted, learn from each other. ""Freezing"" in shock is a common response - as bad as staying quiet. If you don't make a fuss it means your abuser can get away with it so they will do it again.

Look for guy *friends* first. Not hot guys or cool guys - just guys you like and can be comfortable in their company. Above all, guys you can trust. Keep any dates to public places and definitely don't go in their car or drinking, getting high. Be cautious and careful and don't get yourself in situations you can't immediately get away from.",0,False

Reporting it sounds like a good idea if you feel comfortable doing so. You essentially employed your PT to help you in a professional manner and his behaviour has been nothing but extremely inappropriate. 

You are a badass woman and here you are, standing up for yourself. You’ve got this!",2,False
rmdm35,,0,gacGGE,"That badass woman is in you and you must find her if you want to avoid this happening again and again. Sexual predators don't understand ""no"" - it's just a hurdle for them. A signal to keep pressuring their victim until they give in. You can report him but I doubt it will get you anywhere. He will deny it, say you are exaggerating or completely making it up, and without solid objective evidence it is just a matter of his ""established employee"" word against ""shy and nervous customer"" yours. He might get told to watch his step but that's about the most that will happen unless you get lucky and there have been previous complaints. Defo refuse any more training with him. If you keep going back he will think you really want him to have another try. Cancel your gym membership and tell them why. Go to another gym but beware the same thing could happen all over again. Might be just another customer rather than a PT but it's very much a possibility, it's a ""young, fit, bursting with sexual energy"" environment that is like catnip for a sexual predator.

Standing up for yourself is a life skill you must learn if you are going to avoid being exploited. Freezing or the ""stay quiet and hope it goes away"" approach is effectively permission for the abuser to carry on. They know you won't be making a fuss so the coast is clear. Same goes for the ""fake a smile and pretend it was some sort of joke"" response. They won't go away and they will come back for more, as will others you might encounter. So steel your nerve and make a huge fuss, be loud and be noticed. Run screaming through the gym shouting ""HE TRIED TO RAPE ME!"" as you go.

I was sexually harassed at my previous workplace, where a new coworker sneaked up on me and started touching me. I was deeply bothered by it, but I froze up. This happened again, and then he asked me out and I said no. I filed a report and the managers kept saying they were investigsting it. Weeks away, they finally interrogated me, and they insisted on how I didn't say no. I was heartbroken, angry. I didn't know why I finished my tasks, but he was in the department across from mine and it was either think about it or take my mind off of it all through work. He found out I told managers, and he'd retaliate by walking through my department. I had a suspicion he'd mess the aisles up too. He'd stalk me and my family through the store, and it got to the point I just quit. I found out that he harassed a coworker from another department, and he's still there.

Do you have any siblings or cousins that would have had contact with your Grandad when they were of a similar age? Children of that sort of age are not sexually defined, almost androgynous, and acts such as you describe could take place with either sex. Your observation that it didn't manifest again as you got older is possibly an indicator that sexual innocence played a part. If any of them had a similar experience you can pretty much guarantee it is a real memory.

So, assuming it is a real memory, it is paedophilia and I would qualify it as a sexual assault on a child of that age. Incest is defined as sexual contact so that too.

Dealing with it is something else, closure will be hard to reach because he is dead and conflict with the good memories won't be easy to resolve.

People mess up, get driven to do things that part of them doesn't want to do. It's often a trauma in their background that causes it; stuff gets passed down from generation to generation. Your Grandad was likely a victim as well. The roots of what happened could go back a very long time.

I remember back as a senior in highschool they took 10 students - 5 females, 5 males we were a mixed group of the cool kids, the jocks, class clowns (me), art types etc but all of us could command a room if needed, we could speak to our fellow classmates and give presentations without a second thought or being nervous. Anyways we were told we would be going to this week long seminar on sex, relationships and boundaries and then we were to present the stuff we learned to our fellow students without the teachers being present just students talking to students.  

This week long seminar has lasted and ingrained itself in me from the moment I was taught it, to this very day.

Every high school in my district sent the same amount of students as well.  We had professionals of all types: crisis counselors, psychologists, judge, police officers etc - basically any professional that had expertise in the subject was there. 

The main things I took away from this but two sick out:

1) ask permission - still do this with my long time partner
2) if the person had drinks, is drunk or unable to make a decision then the permission is always NO...I remember the police officer telling us males (they separated the sexes for some parts of the seminar) even if she is telling you that she's fine, even if she wants it more than you... It can and will be considered assault because of alcohol/drugs involved... The way the officer explained it was like drunk driving... Someone might look completely sober but if their blood alcohol level is above the limit then they are considered to be drunk driving and will be prosecuted as such.  This officer really stressed that if any mind altering substances were involved it would be wise and in our best interest to not do anything and just make sure the person was safe

They taught us a lot during that week-long seminar and then in turn we taught our fellow classmates... That no means no, never mess with a person who has had a drink, or smoked some weed and much more stuff

Anyways sorry for the long story but I hope they still do these seminars for highschool students. It impacted me immensely.

But what I'm trying to say is:

You obviously couldn't make a proper decision at that moment...it doesn't matter what you were thinking before that moment - at that moment you couldn't.

I hooked up with a guy I had met like a week before when I was studying abroad. I’d never had sex, was in my early 20s, and had grown up in purity culture. I was going through some stuff and enjoyed the attention but made it clear several times to this guy that I wasn’t ready for full-on sex. One day I was feeling particularly low and took him up on going back to his apartment, thinking maybe I could just hang out with him and then go home. Of course it ended up being sex, and even though I was hesitant, he pushed for it. I finally (reluctantly) agreed. I insisted on condom use, was very scared (I’ve always been paranoid about STIs), but it was decent otherwise. He insisted I stay over since it was too late for buses. Then he woke me up already inside me, and it was suuuuuper painful because I had been a virgin so was a bit sore and also wasn’t turned on. He also wasn’t wearing a condom. I asked him to stop several times, but he didn’t listen and/or pretended not to understand (I said it both in my and his native languages, and he had a perfect grasp of mine, too).

I ended up catching something from the encounter. He denied giving me anything (he had no symptoms) and said I must have been lying about being a virgin.

I felt like complete shit about the whole thing for years, still do sometimes. I feel like in some ways, I raped myself for letting myself get into a situation I didn’t want and wasn’t ready for.

But the honest truth is…If there isn’t wholehearted consent, there isn’t consent. And regardless of whether some people categorize your experience as rape, the trauma you feel sees it that way (and lots of us do, as well, just fyi, and legally as well in your case though not in mine).

They convinced me to go with them back to his house to watch a movie and once we were there they both took a Xanax and asked if I wanted to as well. I said no because I had never done it before so he cut it in half and asked if I wanted to do just that half. My ""best friend"" told me to trust her so I did and took it. I half woke up later to him on top of me and her right next to me watching. I didn't even consider the fact that it could have been rape until YEARS later. I thought I had obviously agreed to do that because I was under the influence. It wasn't until the Me Too movement that I realized it actually was rape. Please don't beat yourself up over this.

**What is sexual misconduct?**

* Sexual misconduct includes sexual assault, sexual harassment, stalking, dating violence, and domestic violence.
* Sexual assault refers to sexual contact without consent which includes rape, sexual abuse, attempted rape, and unwanted sexual touching.
* Sexual misconduct may, but need not, include sexual penetration, which includes vaginal intercourse, oral sex, or anal penetration.
* Sexual misconduct may include conduct that involves any unwanted touching or fondling of the genitals or breasts of the victim.
* Date rape and acquaintance rape are considered sexual assault.
* Date rape is a crime of opportunity. It can happen to anyone.

**What is sexual harassment?**

**Sexual Harassment** is any unwanted verbal, written, electronic or physical conduct, of a sexual nature that is intended to cause or could reasonably be expected to cause an individual or group to feel intimidated, demeaned, abused or fearful or have concern for their personal safety because of their sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity or expression or because of their perceived or actual affiliation or association with individuals or groups identified by such characteristics.

**What is sexual assault?**

Sexual assault means an actual or attempted sexual contact with another person without that person’s consent. Sexual assault includes, but is not limited to:

* Involvement in any sexual contact when the victim is unable to consent.
* Intentional and unwelcome touching of, or coercing, forcing, or attempting to coerce or force another to touch a person's intimate parts (defined as genital area, groin, inner thigh, buttocks, or breast).
* Sexual intercourse without consent, including acts commonly referred to as ""rape"".
* Sexual assault includes sexual contact with a person who is unable to consent, either due to age (under 17) or incapacitation (e.g. as a result of intoxication or the influence of other drugs).

**Consensual sex vs. rape**

**Consensual sex** occurs when both parties are able to provide a sober YES to requests for sex and each person is able to participate freely.

**Rape occurs when:**

* Force is used, no matter what the circumstances.
* Someone is unable for any reason---including the effects of alcohol, drugs, coercion, or assault---to knowingly and willingly consent to sex.
* Subtle or overt verbal or physical coercion is used to trick someone into having sex.
* Someone says NO. Whether stated softly or loudly, verbally, or with a shake of the head,
* NO always means STOP!
* It is automatically assumed that someone wants to have sex because she/he is drinking heavily, dresses in a certain way, or agrees to go to another person's room.
* It is assumed that someone is willing to have sex just because that person has had sex before with the same person.

**How to obtain or communicate your consent**

**Consent** is informed, freely given, and mutual. If coercion, intimidation, threats, physical force, duress, or deception are used upon the victim, there is no consent.

**Sexual consent** means you have a clear ""yes, I want to do this"" from your partner **at each and every step of sexual activity.**

* Yes, you do have to ask!
* No means NO.
* No always means STOP what you are doing now!
* No does not mean keep trying until your partner gives in.
* Body language or 'being turned on' does not indicate that someone is giving consent for sex.
* Why? Because it's difficult to differentiate between being scared and being aroused.
* Someone who is scared may begin to perspire, breathe quicker and heavier, shift their eyes around and their heart may pump faster.
* Someone who is aroused may begin to perspire, breathe quicker and heavier, shift their eyes around and their heart may pump faster.

**Ways to gain consent**

* You're hot, can I kiss you?
* Am I moving too fast for you?
* Are we moving at an OK speed?
* Are you comfortable with this?
* Is it OK if I take off my pants?
* Do you want to take off your pants?
* Is it OK if we have sex?

**Ineffective ways to gain consent**

The responses to these questions do not indicate that someone is CONSENTING to have sex:

**""Do you want to go back to my room?""**The answer to this question only relates to entering the room.

**""Do you want to hook up?""**This question and the answer to it are confusing since so many people have different ideas for what 'hooking up' actually means.

**""Do you want to go back to my place and watch a movie?""**The answer to this question only relates to going to someone's place and watching a movie.

3. I refuse to go anywhere secluded with them until we’ve dated for a while because I just don’t trust them… a lot of them will purposely try to get you in secluded places so they can assault you like this demonic man did…

I AGREED despite clear signs, I was sober, I never told him no or to stop. He was a bad sexual partner, but that doesn’t make it SA. When people start telling you YOUR lived experience, it takes a negative experience and makes it about other people’s lives, and not yours. 

Next… You already know mixing Xanax with alcohol was a bad idea, and 100% on you to have made a better choice. Next time: one or the other. A Xanax is not a bad choice. Drinking is not a bad choice. But you only get ONE. 

Last… He is an asshole for sure. He knew you weren’t behaving in a normal way, and thought he could use you to get off quickly with no strings attached. I’m sorry you had the misfortune of meeting such an uncaring, selfish man (we’ve all been there many times). It could be that he didn’t realize why you were so out of it (I’m guessing he didn’t know you took a Xanax?). Perhaps he was really turned off by how disengaged you were, and progressively less and less effort was put in (I’m guessing on your end too). He might have thought, “this is just how she has sex… it’s weird.”

My guess is that after a clearly bad hook up, he was confused why you would want to stay over. Maybe he thinks you were trying to start a relationship after said bad hook up and he was like, “nope, nipping this firmly in the bud. Not giving her a single reason to say I was sending mixed signals.” The fact that he texted you 3 days later probably indicates he’s been negatively ruminating on it too.

I can say that about myself, I can't take medicines like that, or I'll get loopy. It does suck, and it is conflicting. I also have to limit myself to only a drink or 2, or I'll also get loopy from that. We all have to know our limits. You learned yours in a very hard way, and I'm so sorry that happened! Just because you made a mistake, *THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU DESERVED TO BE TREATED THAT WAY!!*

So, here's the absolute most benefit of the doubt that we could possibly give this guy. Perhaps he thought less of you once he saw you wasted and thought you were a ""floozy"" or something. Perhaps he thought this was just what you did, show up to dates and get fucked up and just hook up. But... even if he thought that, he still chose to have sex with you in that state and then *kick you out*, knowing it was dangerous! There's no excuse for that where he's even a decent guy, he's a POS! Even if he completely misread your behavior and the situation and thought you were really into it and really wanted all the stuff you guys were doing, we still round back to him kicking you out. No matter what, he's obviously a fucking asshole. 

And unfortunately, it's likely that you did exactly what he wanted and let yourself be in a vulnerable position so he could do exactly what he did, and he got lucky (in a very disgusting way) that it ended up easy for him. That doesn't mean that you deserved this or that it's okay or that it's even your fault. He's a bad person, and your mistake was being accidentally vulnerable to his will. It happens all the time, in so many different forms. Please don't beat yourself up about this! Just learn. Everybody makes mistakes, and all we can do is learn from them. If you don't end up with any diseases or pregnancy from this incident, then at least there's that.

It's okay to acknowledge your role because that's how it doesn't happen again. You just don't need to be hard on yourself about it, just remember for next time. And I hope you don't cut yourself off from all the positive opportunities out there just because of this asshole. Don't let him keep you down and make you miss out.

Or that as you wandered lost... you could have been dragged off by someone worse... and never seen again.

But if you want to hear that you have indeed been assaulted you came to the right sub-reddit. For a balanced mix of viewpoints, you should probably try to get opinions from somewhere else :)

But my take:

I don't think he intentionally harmed you. He treated you like a guy friend, probably didn't have complete understanding of the female anatomy and wanted to make a fun gesture.

I can totally imagine doing something similar as a 14 year old because I would think it might be fun and I would totally expect him or her to laugh. He wanted to poke your butt through the weird and funny hole in the chair because it sounded like a fun idea. He most likely didn't expect or think about a vagina right in that spot (it can be very surprising for young men where it is actually located).

I have also been in the position myself multiple points in my life where I did slightly stupid things that I thought would be fun, but were either weird, dangerous or something along those lines. Children and to some extens also adults don't always know exactly. Especially if you say you are autistic, shouldn't you then be able to understand that he might also have had troubles to know what is a fun joke and what is not ok? I always find it hard to believe that people quickly judging the stupid actions of kids don't have moments where they did similarily stupid things when they were young.

As you say you have troubles categorizing behaviour, I made two seperate sets under which circumstances I would categorize the behaviours. You can judge then based on what you remember seeing.

Not intentional: good friend before - smile on his face or laughing while poking you through the chair - confused look on his face when you act weird right after - showing strong remorse and crying after finding out how you felt about it - maybe trying to approach you to explain his point to clear the situation

Intentional: weird friend before - serious, uncertain face while poking you - face like he just got caught stealing or distancing himself right after - shifting blame and trying to downplay what he did after being confronted - avoiding talking to you about the incident at all costs

I am sorry that you experienced trauma through his actions. It is possible for someone to cause you pain, your pain to be real and no one really being able to blamed for it or to have wanted that pain to happen. Like in a random car accident where people just didnt see each other. Based on the information you gave I would say that it was just an accident.

As someone (37F) who remembers her early twenties well (and was also diagnosed as bipolar then)... that period of my life was *rough* for me emotionally. Looking back on that time, *everything* seemed a lot like you describe it. I kept letting people in and out of my life that were very unhealthy for me. In hindsight, I wish I had cut more people put of my life earlier who were making me miserable. I was very insecure and felt lucky that people ""put up with me"", so I wasn't very good at seting healthy boundaries.

I don't know if this resonates at all with you, but I only had one or two close friends in high school (who were female), and didn't date until college. I think some of the social skills most people learn in high school, I didn't get to until college. Therapy and meds helped a bit. Mostly it was just *time* though. Graduating college (no more all nighters and constant academic stress), a stable job, stable routine (sleep, eating, etc habits), and a stable and healthy relationship. 

I think the question I'd ask myself is... do you want Matt back in your life, or just *someome* back in life because you feel lonely?

I had extreme morning sickness and kept complaining about how bad it was. Vomiting 24-7. I got so ""proficient"" at vomiting that if a smoker (horrible smell) walked past me, I could turn to the side, throw up, and not break my stride. At my 5-month checkup, they chided me for losing weight. I ranted at the doctor that I keep complaining about the morning sickness, but no one listens. Finally, they listened (literally took me raising my voice for them to do so) and I was prescribed something to help. 

At 38 weeks, they wanted to induce. Baby and I were healthy. I refused. At 39 weeks, same thing. At 40 weeks, same thing. I relented and was induced. Labor was approximately 12 hours, but baby was born healthy, vaginally. My body was wrecked.

Next pregnancy, I used a midwife. She was an RN, CNM, and other letters after her name. She was affiliated with an OB practice at a hospital. 

Those office visits were wonderful. Very little wait time. Remembered my name. Remembered  my toddler's name. When I mentioned the morning sickness, she brought up different holistic remedies, like acupressure, ginger root, and hypnosis. We discussed nutrition; exercise; physical and emotional support for me, upcoming baby, and toddler; post partum depression, etc. At 40 week checkup, both baby and I were healthy, and she mentioned that induction was a possibility at next checkup. She wouldn't let me go past 42 weeks.

I went into labor naturally before 41 weeks. I labored at home for a while, then we got a sitter for toddler, and partner took me to hospital. I had a VERY long labor at hospital. Baby was not coming and was starting to show distress. Midwife gently explained that as much as I wanted to do a vaginal delivery, a c-section was needed at this time. I met the OB in the delivery room with a scalpel in her hand. My little chonker was born healthy. Despite undergoing major surgery (and a c-section is major surgery), my body recovered faster with the second delivery, because I believe, I went into labor naturally and was not induced.

There will be an OB on hand at delivery if needed, but I definitely will feel way better working primarily with the midwife, their bedside manner is infinitely better, and in such a vulnerable state I want someone who I feel like cares about me and what I want, not someone who makes me feel like I’m just a checkbox on their to-do list.",1,False

rz2qqm,,0,auditoryeden,"I'd like to preface this by saying it is totally fine to be upset and he didn't handle this well. Your boundaries were clearly violated and had he been paying attention he should at least have asked if you were okay. Saying no is hard and you should practice doing it in non-romantic, non-sexual contexts, maybe with a friend or family member. Everyone involved knowing that it's practice will not defeat the purpose. If you feel brave you could even ask this guy to help you; his reaction would probably tell you a lot about what to expect in the future.

Right now, neither of you seem to have bothered to communicate expectations. What were your plans for the evening? How do you like to be treated? What activities were you up for, if any? You're right at the start of this relationship, so expectations set now can put you on track for a great time or a shitty one. 

Clearly you need to talk. It's okay to use strategies to help yourself have conversations that past trauma has made especially difficult. My partner and I don't make eye contact during hard talks because I can't. When we first started, I would literally put my head under a blanket because that was what I needed to feel safe communicating my needs. It's taken three years for us to be able to hash things out just sitting in a lit room together, but we still hashed things out in the meanwhile. 

It's okay to practice what you want to say before hand. Literally saying it out loud to yourself. ""I was disappointed that you hadn't made any preparation for our evening, and when you said things were going 'good' it made me feel like they weren't going well enough. Then later, I felt awkward and trapped when we made out. I didn't know what you were doing or why, and I didn't feel like I could say anything about it. That's why I was so upset when I left. I have trouble communicating with partners because of a shitty ex, so I need you to help me avoid situations like the one we were in the other night.""

As an example script that makes a lot of assumptions and probably doesn't suit your purpose. You need to think about what you felt, why, what you need from this guy, what you want from the relationship, and what accomodations you need made for yourself in order to communicate those needs and wants.

Be kind to yourself. You deserve kindness and consideration and generosity. If this guy is sweet and caring he will make the effort if you tell him which efforts you need.",27,False

You feel guilty if you consider saying no, but you were also taught to feel guilty if you say yes by your ex who made you feel like what you could give wasn't good enough, and you feel guilty if you don't communicate clearly and precisely, and you feel guilty for even feeling your feelings.

In reality, you have nothing to feel guilty about, because you haven't done literally anything wrong. It's not bad to have complicated feelings. It's not bad to have trouble speaking up in an uncomfortable situation. It doesn't make *you* bad to have had a bad sexual experience. You don't have to suddenly decide that you're magically okay and sex means nothing and your comfort isn't important, but I think you need to learn not to come down on yourself like this. It may help to talk to somebody professional.

And it's up to you if you want to see that guy again or not. If it's going to hurt you emotionally, you don't have to. If you are sure he wasn't trying to be predatory, you could try talking to him and see how he responds, or you don't have to.

Did he know it was out of your comfort zone?

What preparations would you have wanted?

What communication happened for this visit?

&gt;I grit my teeth and did not kiss back, I closed my hands into fists, and crossed my arms over my chest.

Your body language is something he should have taken note of. He should've checked in. 

You also need to use your words when you aren't into something. If you can't do that, you shouldn't be dating.

Given your last relationship probably having an impact on your comfort with communication and ability to say no, this may be something you need to address with a therapist.

&gt;But right now I feel like I never want to see him again.

It's possible that's what needs to happen.

rz2qqm,[deleted]@0,1,sallis,"I agree strongly with this. Communication is really important, which it sounds like OP recognizes, but is having a very hard time doing (very understandable given the background). 

Of course, body language is an important method of communication, and the new bf failed on that point to not stop immediately upon sensing the OP's body language had changed and checking in. However, the new bf won't be able to work and change things if OP can't talk to him and let him know what is making her uncomfortable or where her boundaries are. 

And all of this is hard given the trauma OP had experienced. I think talking to a therapist that specializes in abusive relationships and trauma would be really helpful for the OP, especially if OP is reacting in a way she doesn't understand... It is likely past trauma being triggered and will likely need to be worked through before she even knows what she'll need from future partners and where her boundaries are. 

OP, there's nothing ""wrong"" with you. You've just experienced trauma and probably haven't fully processed it yet. It means you might have different boundaries than a lot of people at the moment (but don't we all?) and it's a matter of figuring those out while also figuring out what boundaries you might want to have and how to get there. It's okay if you're not ready yet for sex with another partner, or if you're only ready under certain circumstances. You're not broken. But it would benefit you to explore this with a therapist if possible to understand how that trauma is influencing your thoughts, feelings and behaviors, and begin the process of gaining more control over that and finding empowerment.",6,False

rz2qqm,,0,ThePfeiff,"First, I am so sorry you have had to go through this. I think you're incredibly strong. 

Second, please look into getting therapy if that is a possible option for you. I worry you may be struggling with PTSD from your previous relationship, but I am not a professional. 

Third, your feelings are completely valid. This is a good example of ""silence does not convey consent"". Obviously, he may not know much about your previous relationship, but that's kind of the point. He was quick to discuss the formal relationship situation, but it does not seem like he got your consent before touching/kissing you. Maybe he did and you left that out of the story, but it seems like he has a lot of expectations for girlfriends. 

You shouldn't have to tell him to stop, especially in the midst of what seems like a PTSD episode. The limits of your and his physical interactions should have been previously established. It doesn't have to be some big discussion. I usually say something along the lines of : ""I am completely open to all physical affections from you unless I say otherwise at the time. How do you feel about touching/kissing/hugging/etc.?"" Is it romantic? No. Often comes off more clinical than anything, but I know ahead of any sexy time where my boundaries are. You are a real sexual assault victim, and I am so sorry you feel like you aren't. 

I would like you to stop de-victimizing yourself. You fully admit that you were coerced into sex by your last bf. That's sexual assault. Was it violent? Probably not. However, you were mentally and emotionally abused until you gave him what he wanted. If you didn't want to have sex with him and the two of you had sex, he sexually assaulted you. There is nothing wrong with you, but I think you might need to come to terms with the wrongs that were done to you. You have every reason to cry. I cry when I watch a video about a dog with less than four legs trying their best. You can certainly cry about being abused and assaulted. 

You deserve a man who loves and respects you. Neither of these men seem to respect you. They want someone to fill their ideal girlfriend role, without trying to figure out what you do or don't want from them. The only thing that should be ""normal"" in a relationship is consent. You get to define what normal is for you, and a man who actually cares and respects you will seek out your needs and boundaries ahead of time. They will also readily accept them and not try to weasel past them. Then, if you can both do that for each other, the happiness will be much easier to achieve. 

I admire your strength, but it might be time to let yourself feel vulnerable and process your feelings involving these two boys and any others that mistreated you. As someone who is still dealing with PTSD from an abusive ex, it gets better. You find better partners and you become a better partner. Good luck on your journey, and feel free to reach out if I can help you in some way.",7,False

Trauma informed counseling will help you learn to communicate your needs, identify your triggers, and have a healthy relationship.

Take it easy on yourself,  you are still in trauma. There are definitely some warming signs that I am seeing though.  
There is no reason for you to ask to go home,  I know that in your mind right now,  you are probably doing what you were trained to do.  This is something that is going to take a while to stop.  But in the meantime,  I want to reassure you, that you have no reason to ask anyone to leave. You are a free human being.  But,  it will take time. 
It took me 4 months for a friend to help re-train me basically.  My ex-husband always made me sit in front of his chair when anyone came over.  You know like the family dog. So when I left him,  I moved in with a friend,  when anyone came over to his house I would sit in front of his chair,  he would sit behind me and say ""I guess we are sitting on the floor tonight. "" to remind me that I didn't need to do that. 
It takes time to stop doing behavior that we are trained to do.  And there is no reason to feel bad about that behavior,  it was done TO you.  But take the time to un-learn it.  
I am not really sure that being in a new relationship is the best thing for you right now,  but I'm not you.  So will you do me a favor though? Take out some paper and write a list of your own boundaries,  really honest boundaries.  Then check any of those that the new bf had already broken.  Just make sure that you are in a safe,  healthy relationship.

It's hard to constantly try to explain yourself even if someone asks nicely. Not to mention that some people struggle with finding the right words to clearly get their point across.  

I definitely agree that people should try to explain/inform if possible but sometimes it happens too much and you get tired of the same conversation on repeat. Some people are just closed minded and while they seem to genuinely want to understand they can never bring themselves to accept any answers they find or are given. Then there are the difficult people who want to turn everything into a debate riddled with fallacies instead of actually waiting for you to finish. And then we have the impossible, the people who have decided that we don't have discrimination over nearly anything anymore and nothing they see or hear will ever impact what they believe. 

The people who genuinely want and try to educate themselves are, in my opinion, fewer than people seem to believe. Although, I have mostly lived in small towns so that's pretty influential to my opinions. 

Basically, people should try to educate others when they can but they shouldn't do it at the risk of their own mental health and sometimes it's just not worth the effort. 

I also believe that even if it isn't your lived experience you can still try to educate others to the best of your abilities while pointing them in the direction of resources that are directly from a person with lived experience. Sometimes people who really want to learn end up trying to wade through a bunch of confusing and not always true information which makes it difficult to decipher the situation.

pqizwe,AnxietyDepressedFun@1,2,FallingWisteria,"I agree completely, I've had similar issues pop up regarding anxiety with my husband. He's probably the most 'normal' person I know when it comes to mental health. It was hard at the beginning of the relationship especially because often I get anxiety attacks for what appears to be no reason at all and sometimes I don't even know why (although I suspect Autism since my sister was recently diagnosed and we have many similarities regarding mental health). 

It was really a learning experience for both of us (most of my close friends and family also have mental health related problems). I had to learn better communication so he wasn't completely oblivious to the mental tornado forming and he had to learn how to just be there instead of trying to fix it. 

I can't imagine just never explaining it to my husband or just expecting him to know, that's not realistic and certainly a recipe for disaster. I feel like people who advise others to not/that they don't have to educate their family/friends are either too naive to understand how unrealistic that is or too jaded to believe it would make a difference.

I've had exes who just didn't want to know, they wanted to be with me when I wasn't spiraling and panicked but they didn't even want to know about my mental health. It's amazing to finally meet someone who not only supports you but wants to understand so they can better support you &amp; others.

pqizwe,[deleted]@5,6,AnxietyDepressedFun,"The thing is I have listened. I've read each reply with an incredibly heavy heart, two weeks ago I announced on this sub that I had launched the .net version of the abomination that was the Texas Prolife Whistleblower, the response was incredibly encouraging and while receiving threats from pro-life organizations I sought solace in this sub and found it. 

While researching for additional blog topic for that site, my first thought was to come here, a sub that champions women's rights, but what I found was an incredibly aggressive and often times legitimately toxic comments where people claim that having the internet is somehow supposed to erase any and all ignorance and prejudice. People who came here with questions, things they wanted to understand, not just from a concisely edited news article but from actual women's voices, were shut down with overtly aggressive comments about how it's their own fault they couldn't understand the trials and hardships women face.

My husband has been called misogynistic despite his constant and tireless efforts to learn more about my experience because it is not his. I have been called toxic for merely vocalizing my exhaustion at the near constant indigence of other who believe that somehow the existence of accessible information precludes anyone from needing to ask. That is in essence what this post was about. 

So often we imagine that our own experiences are ubiquitous or that they're understood by all because they've been vocalized and while that's a noble and optimistic view of society, it isn't reality. I can read about the experience of people who are different than me and they can read about mine but hearing from and asking about the experience, getting additional information and asking questions to women about their experiences should not be met with such hatred and self righteousness. It's perfectly acceptable to not know something, to learn about it and make changes to your behavior once you've learned such things. 

Imagine a world where in place of marginalized communities speaking for themselves, they were instead discussed only by those who had not experienced the same marginalization. That is what I see as a problem, we are a marginalized group, we have the experience and the understanding that others do not, but if we refuse to speak to it, if our answer to any question is ""it's not my responsibility"", then we allow the responsibility to fall to others. I for one do not want to be responsible for not sharing my experience, my experience as a woman, as the survivor of rape, as a person whose rights have been eroded, as someone who has fertility issues. I want to be a resource, someone who speaks to the things I've experienced with grace and dignity to show others that just because you may not have been able to experience this but you can ask questions to learn about it.

The idea that I'm putting the onus back on women to explain the experience of women seems offensive to some. That we've done enough, that our fight should be over because we've spoken up and the information exists but that is unfortunately not how human nature works. If I've been seen as quarrelsome in the comments it's simply because as an empathetic person it is difficult for me to see an honest and we'll intentioned question be met with the harshest of replies.

I stepped back from responding, from the sub after being an active member, not because I'm unwilling to hear or try and understand the struggles of others, but because in my attempts to understand, my often extremely loquacious replies and attempts at discourse, have been seen as somehow dismissive or argumentative. My inbox has been a mixture of those saying they are sorry my post was met with such hostility because they are afraid of asking and wish they could understand but are fearful of being labeled as toxic for just wanting to know and others who have claimed I'm a racist, sexist ""bitch"" who only wants to hurt women. It's difficult for me to continue reading comments where my efforts are disparaged but I read each one, often more than once. I try to take in what's been said to me with the same grace an aplomb I would if it was said to me in person. I give each weight as I think about how it hurts and how it helps further discussion.

He knows so much about so many different things i have no idea about .

During or talk he eventually asked «the dreaded gential surgery question» basicly wanting to know what i had in my pants.

I know him well, i know his character and intentions, he is a silly , goofy guy.

I answered that i understand this whole trans thing is new to you and that you are curious. 

It is okay to be curious, and please dont ever be afraid to ask me questions .
But please know that this question to some can be very hurtful and upsetting .
I would advice you , if you should encounter someone else like me not to ask them about it.
After all, our private parts are private , until we want to share them (i said that with a humor glint in my eyes)

I for one do not belive in shaming people for their ignorance.

Where would the civil rigths movement be without those strong men and women who fougth hard , but also engaged in conversations, who educated people about the reality of their struggled?

Same with all social reform and progress , we cant excpect people to learn without being educated.

People live very different lifes, with very different points of view and background, you really can not expect people to have accumulated the same exact, sometimes very specialiced knowledge as you have.

There is no denying that not all social reform has happend peacefully.
You can however change a lot of hearts and minds with a open and honest conversation.

It is a shitty thing to shame someone for being un educated, in any way. We dont know their backstory, what they have had to endure in their life .

My husband is an amazing man but he occasionally says something ignorant about women, and I feel like it is my job to help him understand why what he said was hurtful. We watched a clip of Regan talking about ""family value"" and he couldn't hear the same sexist undertones because he's never been targeted by that kind of language. He couldn't know that while Regan was stressing the ""roll of each family member is important for child development, especially regarding domestic responsibility"" which I clearly understood as sexism, Regan is saying women belong in the home. My husband says ""no, no that's not what he said, surely it's not what he meant"" but then Regan just goes ahead &amp; says he blames divorce for mom's having to work outside of the home and how detrimental that is to American life. My husband then understood why I heard it as sexism &amp; he wanted to know more about how often I hear those things, had he ever accidentally said one without realizing it, how could he hear it in the future...

""You should pay your bills"" is different than ""here's money to cover your bills"" because the work performed sits with one side either the person with bills 'works' to pay them or the person helping uses their resources to do so. 

""You should already know"" is unfair, as you say, since that translates to  ""you should be able to pay your bills without having a job"".

To use your analogy... I'm not saying anyone needs to go about dispensing cash to any and everyone for no reason at all not should they be paying someone else's bills but if a person comes to you and says ""Hey I see you have cash, I don't have any &amp; never have but I hear it's useful, can you tell me how to get some?"" and your response is ""No, I don't owe you an explanation"" and then you're mad that they haven't gotten a job to get their own cash then you're perpetuating that ignorance.

He took the time to explain and to potentially expose himself to having his experience dismissed - because a lot of people do that in response - and then you understood. 

In your example, Rocky has the money from working all the time. He is _exhausted_ from working all the time. And he still took the time to not just tell you, “you have to get a job”, because you didn’t know what a “job” is. He defined what it is and how it works. While he’s exhausted from said job.

_Educating_ can be gruesomely exhausting. No, people can’t be expected to know everything. But _wanting_ the people who are victim of the system to perform the labour to educate the rest of us is speaking from a place of privilege. Yes, we need to know about those experiences. And when some people offer them, you say thank you and you leave the rest of them alone. _You_ have to prove to them first that you can receive what they have to say without causing them _more pain_. Hell, one of my friends once pointed out a xenophobic micro-aggression she just had and I dismissed it, even though I’m a hell of a lot more open than most people I’ve met. I only realized it later and I apologized, but the damage was done. Not only she had the pain of receiving the original aggression, but I added to it by saying that it’s not exactly what it was. She felt _confortable_ enough with me to mention it, and I broke that in a stupid moment.

This happens every single day for people who do share their experience. You cannot fault any of them for deciding to stop, or to not do that when they know it’s a real risk. 

On the other hand, you know what you can actually do, other than to educate yourself on your own? It’s to seek and amplify the voices of those who are actually speaking up, instead of vague-shaming the people who can’t, or just don’t want to educate others. Because that’s valid too. 

I’m queer, but I’m incredibly lucky to not have experienced much problem relating to that, both mentally and socially. Speaking about it doesn’t bring up trauma and doesn’t make me feel unsafe. If people don’t get it, it’s not my experience they’re invalidating to my face. So I made it my mission to learn what I can about the rest of the queer community, and when I can, I educate people. And when people with different experiences speak, I listen and I’m grateful for the gift they’re offering. That’s what _allies_ are for.

He is. He will have internalised sexism and, as a man who I assume isn't a hard core activist for feminism, he **is** part of the patriarchy problem. Because he's male, gains privilege from the system and therefore is unlikely to notice or address the oppression that system causes. This doesn't mean I'm accusing him of being a terrible person.

&gt;me sharing the story here were ways to eliminate the gap in information

This is a women focussed sub. If you want to eliminate the gap by sharing information you should do so in a non female gendered space as that's the audience you're trying to educate. 

&gt;Then when someone asks a legitimate question about how to frame a topic there are users saying ""don't bother..."" That's just not helpful to anyone

- It is helpful to those people who are talking to toxic partners, family or friends. 

- It is for those framing a legitimate question about responding to someone who isn't a husband or sister (who is overstepping the level of relationship)

- It is when they've tried 6 different ways already and the person isn't listening. (Because this is wasted time and effort)

- It is when the person is asking a question that really should be a bare minimum piece of knowledge.

""Don't bother"" *is* a legitimate response in some cases. 

And even when it's a legitimate question, asked in all the right ways etc **it's still not someone else's job to educate them**.

I hadn't ever thought about pronouns actually, outside of English class, so when she told me a mutual friend was still using ""he"" and asked if I would say something, I understood. I never experienced being mis-gendered and I'd never thought about the pronouns I used but after that I was able to do a better job &amp; even help explain it to others.

I get being tired of saying the same thing, I'm a woman in Texas right now and explaining why SB8 is about all women, why it's so insanely sexist and disturbing gets exhausting and sometimes it's just emotionally too much to keep explaining it &amp; that's okay but I'm tired of seeing people encouraging others to not share. Essentially calling anyone who doesn't know a thing intentionally ignorant. If someone says something or does something that's offensive and you are too exhausted to explain it then say something like ""look into XYZ"" but telling people they should already know something just because it's been said before by someone else is not enough to support continued understanding.

Literally all I want is for people to recognize that every experience is different, and that's okay, but if we want people to understand those differences we have to continue talking about them and being compassionate when someone is genuinely unaware.",11,True
pqizwe,AnxietyDepressedFun@3,4,purplelattice,"&gt;Unpopular Opinion: I'm tired of hearing the whole ""it's not your job to teach someone about XYZ""...

This is your title. *You* may feel that it is your job, but to tell others that are being hurt and victimized that they simply must do more is absolutely harmful and wrong. It is NOT their job. That really should be the takeaway here.

It is *empowering* for many people to be told they can step back. That *their* health, both physical and mental, is important and they can choose that. We have been conditioned to take on more emotional labor than can be supported and getting supported that that does not make you weak, that does not mean you are not doing enough, that you are not failing is absolutely a positive thing. Telling someone hurting that you are tired of them not educating because *you* choose to take on that burden with this one thing is destructive and not allyship. The worst kind of ally actually.

This is exactly what we are talking about here. Lots of people doing the emotional labor of telling you *why* we may say that and the effects constantly educating does, and you are saying that is not enough because the ignorant need educating and it is their duty to educate them. This is the educational opportunity you are talking about and yet when it is *your* behavior and *your* words being challenged, look what happened. You are not taking this on. You are not understanding. And that really is the outcome of most times educating on why something is hurtful. It is the arguing that you *should* do it anyway because the other person doesn't see the issue with it.

If your post title had been ""I am really tired of how most people take being educated on where they are wrong and how that discourages others from speaking up and educating"" that would be wonderful! It is understanding. It is putting the focus not on your feelings but on the feelings of those actually being hurt. If your post body related that story of your coworker and then ended with saying how you are committing to taking on some of his burden by using every chance you can to call out racists and educate them, that would be wonderful!

But you didn't. And that is exactly why so many simply don't engage. That is why ignorance continues because even when we try, we aren't doing enough. Even when we lend emotional support to someone to let them know that they can prioritize their own health, we are told that those in the wrong are tired of not being taught. What you do with this educational opportunity is up to you. But understand it will show everyone what happens when you engage and try to educate.",51,False

My username is literally my own mental health struggles so implying that I'm attempting to force anyone to deny themselves proper care is really inaccurate.

I'm not saying anyone is entitled to understanding your experience but I am saying that if you continue to tell people they should already understand and they tell you they don't but they want to and again you refuse to share and then you encourage others to refuse to share...

Again, it's praiseworthy to educate. Doesn't mean that not educating and taking a step back is not okay, that it's failing your societal duty.

With your example, if someone believes that they must pick up every piece of litter they see, regardless of the fact they have hurt their back, then they need to be told they can stop and not pick it up. That their health matters and they shouldn't keep bending over to pick up that litter now. That it doesn't mean they are giving up their place in a nice society.

What I don't think you and some others are getting is that you see a piece of litter every once in a while and (may) pick it up. Some people are followed and have litter dropped in front of them, out of your sight so you don't see that happening, and telling them they don't have the responsibility and can move on instead of getting bogged down with another litter picking exercise that probably has shit hidden in it is wonderful to hear. Because otherwise they will believe if they don't pick up the shit pieces of litter that people are dumping at their feet, that they are failing or that people like you will tell them they aren't doing their part.

Someone on this same thread said I should divorce my husband or get therapy because he didn't know how a tampon worked and asked me. He literally is an only child, has never lived with a woman and has never contemplated the different ways a tampon might be inefficient or uncomfortable, so he asked and that is enough for people to claim he's a misogynist who doesn't love me or support me.

I still think it’s true that “it’s no one else’s job to teach me about XYZ”. But at the same time, in any sort of relationship, if you don’t tell me why you’re upset about something, I’m not going to understand why I’m wrong. 

I think the difference is that “it’s not your job to teach someone about XYZ” should be taken in the context of strangers and feeling like you have an obligation to explain things to them. In the context or friends, the friendship isn’t going to last long if you don’t communicate why you’re upset.

pqizwe,,0,Smartass_Narrator,"Misogyny, sexism, racism, marginalization, etc is such a talked about topic that if someone wants you specifically(or a person in or defending the marginalized group) to explain it to them it’s not because they want to understand. They want to argue. They want to devalue that view point that says they were wrong somehow and should change (no one likes feeling they were wrong, we naturally fight against it as a self preservation method). They want to tire the other person out with emotional labor because they want to silence them, or at least quiet them. They have nothing to lose by demanding to be educated and so it’s not taxing to them to argue. Then can do it all day long. The other person, who is very much affected by the subject, has to be a perfect educator or risk entrenching the reluctant learner all the more into their belief that they don’t have to reevaluate themselves. “See, they couldn’t quickly convince me, therefore it’s not me who’s wrong, it’s just that other people are simply too sensitive!” Ive seen it happen. 

Is every situation like that? No. But at this point in the game, most of them are. If the other person truly wanted to be educated they could absolutely find essays, videos, documentaries, debates, etc to better learn about it. That’s not what they want though because they can’t argue against an article or a video. They *can* argue with a person. They can feel validated in not changing their ways if the other person fails to easily show them the entirety of a giant complicated and far reaching subject (like sexism or racism). It’s a heavy burden to expect someone else to carry to be a well rounded enough educator to convince every reluctant and uninvested person that their actions/thoughts/beliefs/stance is harmful.

So, no, it’s not someone’s job to educate another person. If they’re aware enough to ask the question “why is this offensive” they are aware enough to find the answers. And if they’re not willing to do the legwork, then the burden of being ill educated is on them, where it belongs.

But I feel it's very individualist and short sighted. We don't live alone in society, and if we aim to improve our society, we should do more than only what's  required from us in general.

I can't speak about being a woman, I'm a 40 year old gay guy from southamerica. I came to this reddit to learn, and I have learned a lot on things I had no idea about. But I can teach others about what being LGBTQ means, or what being from outside the 1st world means.

And I have done so, each and every time I have had the chance to do so, I have done it. no matter how tiring, repetitive annoying, an specially  that feeling of vulnerability of having your own life and experience on display. And I'll keep on doing it probably till the day I die.

Is it my job? or my obligation? of course it's not, but I want to live in a better society so others don't have to go through some of the shit I went through. I don't want more young boys to be left bleeding on the street because some bigot gang beat them up for being gay, like it happened to me. And because of that I'll always do whatever I can to help.

Of course there are many times where you see the other person is just playing innocent or ignorant, but they really don't want to learn, and in those cases it's not worth it at all.

But in general, when I see someone who genuinely wants to learn about it, I'll always arm myself with my knowledge and experience and explain it to them, because I think teaching others might do a difference, there's always a chance I might change things for the better for those who come after us.

I count myself as one of the lucky ones because of the patience my wife has in sharing her experiences of living life as woman.  I will say with, absolute certainty, that I will never truly understand her life.  I just can't.  There is no way for me to experience life through a woman's perspective because I can't simply insert a filter composed of the accumulated exhaustion for daily injustices she experiences.  Even if I were to somehow able to relive all of that, it would still be seasoned through my own experiences!

It's unfortunate that men can't just understand, and I understand that it can get tiring to have to repeatedly hear things like ""Imagine if it was your daughter."",  ""Imagine if it was your wife."",  but without having some source of reference, I wouldn't have a clue and I think that's likely true for many men.

The second time kine or ended our brief relationship.  I don't feel assaulted, but my boundaries violated. I don't know if that is even true.  I felt heartbroken and foolish and like I am not capable or don't enjoy being sexual.  I was maybe verbal about it at the time, I was in obvious discomfort, aand in many ways she enjoyed making me squirm.  She wasn't being that rough and I might have thought, maybe I will start enjoying thiw.

We had shared our extreme sex stories as we began to date before anything happened, but it was only our 3rd or 4th time in bed.

Writing this makes me sad, I don't feel angry.  I feel hurt.  I feel anxious about having sex again.  I think I am nervous I won't be able to rush into anything and have sex without a month or at least weeks of courting.  I am easy going and often let things happen to me and let her set the pace, perhaps how I got in trouble.  I feel I need more boundaries but it feels sad to have them.  I have had a lot of trauma and PTSD, not related to sex at all, and now I guess I feel hyper vigilant.

To me it is not a feeling of assault, but being used and not respected.  That I was an object, and I was idealizing this woman because I was lonely.  She kind of fell to pieces over time and I don't feel anger at her, but compassion.  But I wanted not to be with her.  She showed up one time later.  And I let her in and we ended up in bed and It was one sided and I really wanted to not have been there.  I don't think I could stay hard.  That felt more of a violation but there was nothing in particularly I verbally said.  I just felt, let's get this over with so you go.  

I think over a lifetime this must happen to near everyone.  I have probably done it to women, though I am not sure when, in high school maybe when I had no idea what I was doing?  But is that an excuse?  I am not upset about the whole thing, juat the 3 minutes she did something I truly did not enjoy and she enjoyed my discomfort.  

Idk.  Why am I thinking about it months later randomly.  Why did I tell a friend about it after it happened?",0,False

Really I just want to be able to share a story that helps reframe rape. I would have never thought I could be a person that didn’t recognize their own rape. If strong and empowered women can do it, my heart breaks for the women that were not told they had worth and magic inside them from a young age like I did.",3,True

mso774,,0,tessa8rose,"Pardon me for being slightly obsessed with my own story, but damn these downvotes hurt. I’m sad either way if it’s men putting me in my place/denying behavior like this leads to rape or if it’s women downplaying clear rape. Either way, do better and give the young women in your life a beacon to hold on to if they were to be victimized in this way.",3,True
